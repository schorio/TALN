76  WHAT  IS  ART? 
a  labouring  man,  with  its  endlessly  varied  forms  of  labour, 
and  the  dangers  connected  with  this  labour  on  sea  and 
underground;  his  migrations,  the  intercourse  with  his  em 
ployers,  overseers,  and  companions  and  with  men  of  other 
religions  and  other  nationalities ;  his  struggles  with  nature 
and  with  wild  beasts,  the  associations  with  domestic  animals, 
the  work  in  the  forest,  on  the  steppe,  in  the  field,  the  garden, 
the  orchard ;  his  intercourse  with  wif e  and  children,  not  only 
as  with  people  near  and  dear  to  him,  but  as  with  co-workers 
and  helpers  in  labour,  replacing  him  in  time  of  need ;  his 
concern  in  all  economic  questions,  not  as  matters  of  display 
or  discussion,  but  as  problems  of  life  for  himself  and  his 
family ;  his  pride  in  self-suppression  and  service  to  others, 
his  pleasures  of  refreshment;  and  with  all  these  interests 
permeated  by  a  religious  attitude  towards  these  occurrences — 
all  this  to  us,  who  have  not  these  interests  and  possess  no 
religious  perception,  seems  monotonous  in  comparison  with 
those  small  enjoyments  and  insignificant  cares  of  our  life, — 
a  life,  not  of  labour  nor  of  production,  but  of  consumption  and 
destruction  of  that  which  others  have  produced  for  us.  We 
think  the  feelings  experienced  by  people  of  our  day  and 
our  class  are  very  important  and  varied;  but  in  reality 
i,  almost  all  the  feelings  of  people  of  our  class  amount  to 
j|:!but  three  very  insignificant  and  simple  feelings — the  feeling 
jljbf  pride,  the  feeling  of  sexual  desire,  and  the  feeling  of 
[[{ (weariness  of  life.  These  three  feelings,  with  their  out- 
'growths,  form  almost  the  only  subject-matter  of  the  art  of the  rich  classes. 
At  first,  at  the  very  beginning  of  the  separation  of  the 
exclusive  art  of  the  upper  classes  from  universal  art,  its 
chief  subject-matter  was  the  feeling  of  pride.  It  was  so  at 
the  time  of  the  Renaissance  and  after  it,  when  the  chief 
subject  of  works  of  art  was  the  laudation  of  the  strong — 
popes,  kings,  and  dukes:  odes  and  madrigals  were  written  in 
their  honour,  and  they  were  extolled  in  cantatas  and  hymns ;
