76 Chapter 4 Looking at ArtNonobjective art, as you learned in Les-
son 3, began in the early 1900s. By avoidingsubject matter, nonobjective artists created anew means of self-expression. Since that time,other artists have taken a more middle-of-the-road approach to subject matter. They have
produced art that is abstract. This means 
having a recognizable subject that is shown in anunrealistic manner.The work in Figure 4–12 is an example of
abstract art. Its subject is a character fromGreek mythology. His name is Icarus. Accord-ing to legend, Icarus tried to fly using wingsheld together with wax. Ignoring warnings,Icarus flew too close to the sun. The waxmelted, and the youth fell to his death. Studythis work of art. Can you recognize it as afalling figure? Creating an Abstract Figure
