60  WHAT  IS  ART  J 
Scriptures,  since  they  were  considered  to  be  inspired  only 
because  the  tradition  of  the  Church  decided  it  so. 
So  that  the  majority  of  the  highest  classes  of  that  age, 
even  the  popes  and  the  ecclesiastics,  really  believed  in 
nothing  at  all.  In  the  Church  doctrine  these  people  did 
not  believe,  for  they  saw  its  insolvency ;  but  neither  could 
they  follow  Francis  of  Assisi,  Keltchitsky,1  and  most  of  the 
heretics,  in  acknowledging  the  moral,  social  teaching  of 
Christ,  for  that  teaching  undermined  their  social  position. 
And  so  these  people  remained  without  any  religious  view 
of  life.  And,  having  none,  they  could  have  no  standard 
wherewith  to  estimate  what  was  good  and  what  was  bad  art 
but  that  of  personal  enjoyment.  And,  having  acknowledged 
their  criterion  of  what  was  good  to  be  pleasure,  i.e.  beauty, 
these  people  of  the  upper  classes  of  European  society  went 
back  in  their  comprehension  of  art  to  the  gross  conception 
of  the  primitive  Greeks  which  Plato  had  already  condemned. 
And  conformably  to  this  understanding  of  life  a  theory  of 
art  was  formulated. 
1  Keltchitsky,  a  Bohemian  of  the  fifteenth  century,  was  the  author 
of  a  remarkable  book,  The  Net  of  Faith,  directed  against  Church  and 
State.  It  is  mentioned  in  Tolstoy's  The  Kingdom  of  God  is  Within You. â€” Trans.
