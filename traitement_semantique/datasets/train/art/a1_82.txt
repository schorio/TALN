Interpreting
In interpreting a work, the critic asks,
“What is the artist saying to me? Whatmoods, feelings, or ideas are expressed?”The work’s content is the focus of this step.Look closely at Figure 4–6b.
●What emotion is communicated by the
look and body language of the taller boy?Would you say that he stands tall and
appears sure of himself? 
●Contrast these observations with thefacial expression and posture of thesmaller boy. 
●Why has the artist placed the boysagainst a darker, textured background?Does this focus your attention on their
faces and facial expressions? What doyou think the artist has accomplished bydrawing the viewer’s eyes to the boys’expressions and body language?
●What visual clue can you find in thedistance off to the left that might explainthe boys’ behavior?
Interpretation can be the most challeng-
ing step in art criticism. It is challenging be-cause you must use your imagination. Do notbe afraid to make an interpretation that is different from someone else’s. Your interpre-tation will depend on what you have experi-enced in life.
