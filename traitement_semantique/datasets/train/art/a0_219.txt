176  WHAT  IS  ART? 
People  of  our  time  and  of  our  society  are  delighted  with 
Baudelaires,  Verlaines,  More"ases,  Ibsens,  and  Maeterlincks in  poetry ;  with  Monets,  Manets,  Puvis  de  Chavannes, 
Burne- Joneses,  Stucks,  and  Bocklins  in  painting;  with 
Wagners,  Listzs,  Kichard  Strausses,  in  music ;  and  they 
are  no  longer  capable  of  comprehending  either  the  highest 
or  the  simplest  art. 
In  the  upper  classes,  in  consequence  of  this  loss  of 
capacity  to  be  infected  ^by  works  of  art,  people  grow  up,  are 
educated,  and  live,  lacking  the  fertilising,  improving  influ 
ence  of  art,  and  therefore  not  only  do  not  advance  towards 
perfection,  do  not  become  kinder,  but,  on  the  contrary, 
possessing  highly-developed  external  means  of  civilisation, 
they  yet  tend  to  become  continually  more  savage,  more 
coarse,  and  more  cruel. 
Such  is  the  result  of  the  absence  from  our  society  of  the 
activity  of  that  essential  organ — art.  But  the  consequences 
of  the  perverted  activity  of  that  organ  are  yet  more  harmful. 
And  they  are  numerous. 
The  first  consequence,  plain  for  all  to  see,  is  the  enormous 
expenditure  of  the  labour  of  working  people  on  things  which 
are  not  only  useless,  but  which,  for  the  most  part,  are  harm 
ful  ;  and  more  than  that,  the  waste  of  priceless  human  lives 
on  this  unnecessary  and  harmful  business.  It  is  terrible  to 
consider  with  what  intensity,  and  amid  what  privations, 
millions  of  people — who  lack  time  and  opportunity  to  attend 
to  what  they  and  their  families  urgently  require — labour 
for  10,  12,  or  14  hours  on  end,  and  even  at  night,  setting 
the  type  for  pseudo-artistic  books  which  spread  vice  among 
mankind,  or  working  for  theatres,  concerts,  exhibitions,  and 
picture  galleries,  which,  for  the  most  part,  also  serve  vice  J 
but  it  is  yet  more  terrible  to  reflect  that  lively,  kindly 
children,  capable  of  all  that  is  good,  are  devoted  from  their 
early  years  to  such  tasks  as  these:  that  for  6,  8,  or  10 
hours  a  day,  and  for  10  or  15  years,  some  of  them  should
