118 Chapter 6 Perceiving NatureHave you ever had days when things just
didn’t seem to go right? So, it seems, does na-ture. Such a day is the subject of Figure 6–16.
The work pictures a bleak, rainy afternoon.Unlike the works you studied in the previouslesson, there is no fury in the storm depictedhere—just gloom. Notice the churning grayclouds overhead. See the rippling puddlesunderfoot of anyone unlucky enough to beout on such a day. The monochromatic tones
of clouds and buildings make you glad to beinside, where it is safe and dry. That is, in fact,where you are as you look at this scene. Didyou notice the blurred lines on the windowat the left? The distortion is caused by the rainon your own window—the one you are gaz-ing through. Can you find the single raindropthat has beaded on the glass?
