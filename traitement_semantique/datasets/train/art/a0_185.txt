142  WHAT  IS  ART? 
have  just  heard  from  men  whose  opinion  appears  to  them 
authoritative. 
If  some  people  do  feel  insulted  by  the  absurdity  and 
spuriousness  of  the  whole  thing,  they  are  timidly  silent,  as 
sober  men  are  timid  and  silent  when  surrounded  by  tipsy 
ones. 
And  thus,  thanks  to  the  masterly  skill  with  which  it 
counterfeits  art  while  having  nothing  in  common  with  it, 
a  meaningless,  coarse,  spurious  production  finds  acceptance 
all  over  the  world,  costs  millions  of  roubles  to  produce,  and 
assists  more  and  more  to  pervert  the  taste  of  people  of  the 
upper  classes  and  their  conception  of  what  is  art.
