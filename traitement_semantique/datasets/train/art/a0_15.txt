xii  INTRODUCTION. 
These  works,  in  chronological  order,  are — 
My  Confession. 
A    Criticism  of  Dogmatic  Theology,  which  has  never 
been  translated. 
The  Four  Gospels  Harmonised  and  Translated,  of 
which  only  two  parts,  out  of  three,  have  as  yet 
appeared  in  English. 
What  I  Believe,  sometimes  called  My  Religion. 
The  Gospel  in  Brief. 
What  are  we  to  do  then?  sometimes  called  in  English 
What  to  do? 
On  Life,  which  is   not  an  easy  work  in  the  original, 
and  has  not  been  satisfactorily  translated.1 
The  Kingdom  of  God  is  within  you;  and 
The  Christian  Teaching,  which  appeared  after    What 
is  Art  ?  though  it  was  written  before  it. 
To  these  scientific  works  I  am  inclined  to  add  The 
Kteutzer  Sonata,  with  the  Sequel  or  Postscript  explaining 
its  purpose ;  for  though  The  Kreutzer  Sonata  is  a  story, 
the  understanding  of  sexual  problems,  dealt  with  explicitly 
in  the  Sequel,  is  an  integral  part  of  that  comprehension 
of  life  which  causes  Tolstoy  to  admire  Christ,  Buddha,  or 
Francis  of  Assisi. 
These  ten  works  treat  of  the  meaning  of  our  life ;  of  the 
problems  raised  by  the  fact  that  we  approve  of  some  things 
and  disapprove  of  others,  and  find  ourselves  deciding 
which  of  two  courses  to  pursue. 
Religion,  Government,  Property,  Sex,  War,  and  all  the 
relations  in  which  man  stands  to  man,  to  his  own  con 
sciousness,  and  to  the  ultimate  source  (which  we  call 
God)  from  whence  that  consciousness  proceeds — are  ex 
amined  with  the  utmost  frankness. 
1  Bolton  Hall  has  recently  published  a  little  work,  Life,  and  Love, 
and  Death,  with  the  object  of  making  the  philosophy  contained  in  On 
Life  more  easily  accessible  in  English.
