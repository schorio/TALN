external  authorities  (Popes,  Bibles,  Councils)  supreme,  and 
cling  to  superstitions  (their  oivn  miracles,  legends,  and 
myths),  thus  separating  themselves  from  communion  with 
the  rest  of  mankind.  Nor  does  he  re-explain  why  he  (like 
Christ)  says  "  pitiable  is  your  plight — ye  rich,"  who  live 
artificial  lives,  maintainable  only  by  the  unbrotherly  use  of 
force  (police;  and  soldiers),  but  blessed  are  ye  poor — who, 
by  your  way  of  life,  are  within  easier  reach  of  brotherly  con 
ditions,  if  you  will  but  trust  to  reason  and  conscience,  and 
change  the  direction  of  your  hearts  and  of  your  labour, — 
working  no  more  primarily  from  fear  or  greed,  but  seeking 
first  the  kingdom  of  righteousness,  in  which  all  good  things 
will  be  added  unto  you.  He  merely  summarises  it  all  in  a 
few  sentences,  defining  the  "  religious  perception  "  of  to-day, 
which  alone  can  decide  for  us  "the  degree  of  importance 
both  of  the  feelings  transmitted  by  art  and  of  the  informa 
tion  transmitted  by  science." 
"  The  religious  perception  of  our  time,  in  its  widest  and 
most  practical  application,  is  the  consciousness  that  our 
well-being,  both  material  and  spiritual,  individual  and 
collective,  temporal  and  eternal,  lies  in  the  growth  of 
brotherhood  among  men — in  their  loving  harmony  with 
one  another"  (p.  159). 
And  again  : 
"  However  differently  in  form  people  belonging  to  our Christian  world  may  define  the  destiny  of  man ;  whether 
they  see  it  in  human  progress  in  whatever  sense  of  the 
words,  in  the  union  of  all  men  in  a  socialistic  realm,  or  in 
the  establishment  of  a  commune;  whether  they  look  forward 
to  the  union  of  mankind  under  the  guidance  of  one  universal 
Church,  or  to  the  federation  of  the  world, — however 
various  in  form  their  definitions  of  the  destination  of  human 
life  may  be,  all  men  in  our  times  already  admit  that  the 
highest  well-being  attainable  by  men  is  to  be  reached  by 
their  union  with  one  another"  (p.  188).
