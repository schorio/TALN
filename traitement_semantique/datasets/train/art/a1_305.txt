3.Gently crease the paper along
the line you made.
To score curved lines, use the
same technique. Make sureyour curves are wide enough toensure a clean fold. Too tight acurve will cause the paper towrinkle (Figure T–29).
27. Making a Tissue Paper
Collage 
For your first experience with
tissue, make a free design withthe tissue colors. Start with thelightest colors of tissue first andsave the darkest for last. It isdifficult to change the color ofdark tissue by overlapping itwith other colors. If one areabecomes too dark, you mightcut out a piece of white paper,glue it over the dark area care-fully, and apply new colors overthe white area. 1.Apply a coat of adhesive to
the area where you wish toplace the tissue.
2.Place the tissue down care-
fully over the wet area (Fig-ure T–30). Don’t let yourfingers get wet.
3.Then add another coat of
adhesive over the tissue. Ifyour brush picks up anycolor from the wet tissue,rinse your brush in water and let it dry before using it again.
4.Experiment by overlapping
colors. Allow the tissue towrinkle to create textures asyou apply it. Be sure that allthe loose edges of tissue areglued down.
28. Working with Glue 
When applying glue, alwaysstart at the center of the surfaceyou are coating and work outward.•When gluing papers together,
don’t use a lot of glue, just adot will do. Use dots in thecorners and along the edges.Press the two surfacestogether. Keep dots at least
1⁄2inch in from the edge of
your paper.
•Handle a glued surface
carefully with only yourfingertips. Make sure yourhands are clean beforepressing the glued surfaceinto place.
•Note: The glue should be as
thin as possible. Thick orbeaded glue will create ridgeson your work.
