WHAT  IS  ART ?  191 
The  consequences  of  counterfeit  art  are  the  perversion  of 
man,  pleasure  which  never  satisfies,  and  the  weakening  of 
man's  spiritual  strength.

should  understand,  in  order  to  avoid  the  filthy  torrent  of 
depraved  and  prostituted  art  with  which  we  are  deluged.
