WHAT  IS  ART?  17 
Evidently  this  new  meaning  given  to  beauty  by  European 
thought  begins  to  be  assimilated  by  Russian  society. 
And  what  really  is  this  meaning  1  What  is  this  "  beauty  " 
as  it  is  understood  by  the  European  peoples  ? 
In  order  to  answer  this  question,  I  must  here  quote  at 
least  a  small  selection  of  those  definitions  of  beauty  most 
generally  adopted  in  existing  aesthetic  systems.  I  especially 
beg  the  reader  not  to  be  overcome  by  dulness,  but  to  read 
these  extracts  through,  or,  still  better,  to  read  some  one  of 
the  erudite  aesthetic  authors.  ^N"ot  to  mention  the  voluminous 
German  sestheticians,  a  very  good  book  for  this  purpose 
would  be  either  the  German  book  by  Kralik,  the  English  work 
by  Knight,  or  the  French  one  by  Leveque.  It  is  necessary  to 
read  one  of  the  learned  aesthetic  writers  irl  order  to  form  at 
first-hand  a  conception  of  the  variety  in  opinion  and  the 
frightful  obscurity  which  reigns  in  this  region  of  specula 
tion;  not,  in  this  important  matter,  trusting  to  another's 
report. 
This,  for  instance,  is  what  the  German  aesthetician 
Schasler  says  in  the  preface  to  his  famous,  voluminous, 
and  detailed  work  on  aesthetics  : â€” 
"Hardly  in  any  sphere  of  philosophic  science  can  we 
find  such  divergent  methods  of  investigation  and  exposition, 
amounting  even  to  self-contradiction,  as  in  the  sphere  of 
aesthetics.  On  the  one  hand  we  have  elegant  phraseology 
without  any  substance,  characterised  in  great  part  by  most 
one-sided  superficiality;  and  on  the  other  hand,  accompany 
ing  undeniable  profundity  of  investigation  and  richness  of 
subject-matter,  we  get  a  revolting  awkwardness  of  philosophic 
terminology,  enfolding  the  simplest  thoughts  in  an  apparel 
of  abstract  science  as  though  to  render  them  worthy  to 
enter  the  consecrated  palace  of  the  system ;  and  finally^ 
between  these  two  methods  of  investigation  and  exposition, 
there  is  a  third,  forming,  as  it  were,  the  transition  from  one 
to  the  other,  a  method  consisting  of  eclecticism,  now  flaunt
