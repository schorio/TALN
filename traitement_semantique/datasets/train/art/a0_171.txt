CHAPTER  XIII 
To  what  an  extent  people  of  our  circle  and  time  have  lost  the 
capacity  to  receive  real  art,  and  have  become  accustomed 
to  accept  as  art  things  that  have  nothing  in  common  with  it, 
is  best  seen  from  the  works  of  Richard  Wagner,  which  have 
latterly  come  to  be  more  and  more  esteemed,  not  only  by 
the  Germans  but  also  by  the  French  and  the  English,  as  the 
very  highest  art,  revealing  new  horizons  to  us. 
The  peculiarity  of  Wagner's  music,  as  is  known,  consists 
in  this,  that  he  considered  that  music  should  serve  poetry, 
expressing  all  the  shades  of  a  poetical  work. 
The  union  of  the  drama  with  music,  devised  in  the 
fifteenth  century  in  Italy  for  the  revival  of  what  they 
imagined  to  have  been  the  ancient  Greek  drama  with 
music,  is  an  artificial  form  which  had,  and  has,  success 
only  among  the  upper  classes,  and  that  only  when  gifted 
composers,  such  as  Mozart,  Weber,  Rossini,  and  others, 
drawing  inspiration  from  a  dramatic  subject,  yielded  freely 
to  the  inspiration  and  subordinated  the  text  to  the  music, 
so  that  in  their  operas  the  important  thing  to  the  audience 
was  merely  the  music  on  a  certain  text,  and  not  the  text 
at  all,  which  latter,  even  when  it  was  utterly  absurd,  as, 
f,or  instance,  in  the  Magic  Flute,  still  did  not  prevent  the 
music  from  producing  an  artistic  impression. 
Wagner  wishes  to  correct  the  opera  by  letting  music 
submit  to  the  demands  of  poetry  and  unite  with  it.  But 
each  art  has  its  own  definite  realm,  which  is  not  identical 
with  the  realm  of  other  arts,  but  merely  comes  in 128
