58  WHAT  IS  ART? 
the  complex  mythology  they  had  borrowed  from  all  the 
conquered  nations,  and  it  was  consequently  necessary  to  find 
a  completely  new  conception  of  life,  the  people  of  the  Middle 
Ages,  when  they  doubted  the  truth  of  the  Church  teaching, 
had  no  need  to  seek  a  fresh  one.  That  Christian  teaching 
which  they  professed  in  a  perverted  form  as  Church  doctrine, 
had  mapped  out  the  path  of  human  progress  so  far  ahead, 
that  they  had  but  to  rid  themselves  of  those  perversions 
which  hid  the  teaching  announced  by  Christ,  and  to  adopt 
its  real  meaning — if  not  completely,  then  at  least  in  some 
greater  degree  than  that  in  which  the  Church  had  held  it. 
And  this  was  partially  done,  not  only  in  the  reformations  of 
Wyclif,  Huss,  Luther,  and  Calvin,  but  by  all  that  current 
of  non-Church  Christianity,  represented  in  earlier  times 
by  the  Paulicians,  the  Bogomili,1  and,  afterwards,  by  the 
Waldenses  and  the  other  non-Church  Christians  who  were 
called  heretics.  But  this  could  be,  and  was,  done  chiefly 
by  poor  people — who  did  not  rule.  A  few  of  the  rich  and 
strong,  like  Francis  of  Assisi  and  others,  accepted  the 
Christian  teaching  in  its  full  significance,  even  though  it 
undermined  their  privileged  positions.  But  most  people  of 
the  upper  classes  (though  in  the  depth  of  their  souls  they 
had  lost  faith  in  the  Church  teaching)  could  not  or  would 
not  act  thus,  because  the  essence  of  that  Christian  view 
of  life,  which  stood  ready  to  be  adopted  when  once  they 
rejected  the  Church  faith,  was  a  teaching  of  the  brotherhood 
(and  therefore  the  equality)  of  man,  and  this  negatived 
those  privileges  on  which  they  lived,  in  which  they  had 
grown  up  and  been  educated,  and  to  which  they  were 
accustomed.  Not,  in  the  depth  of  their  hearts,  believing  in 
the  Church  teaching, — which  had  outlived  its  age  and  had 
no  longer  any  true  meaning  for  them, — and  not  being  strong 
1  Eastern  sects  well  known  in  early  Church  history,  who  rejected 
the  Church's  rendering  of  Christ's  teaching  and  were  cruelly  per secuted.  —Trans.
