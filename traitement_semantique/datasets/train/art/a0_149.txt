CHAPTEE   XI 
BECOMING  ever  poorer  and  poorer  in  subject-matter  and 
more  and  more  unintelligible  in  form,  the  art  of  the  upper 
classes,  in  its  latest  productions,  has  even  lost  all  the 
characteristics  of  art,  and  has  been  replaced  by  imitations 
of  art.  Not  only  has  upper-class  art,  in  consequence  of  its 
separation  from  universal  art,  become  poor  in  subject-matter 
and  bad  in  form,  i.e.  ever  more  and  more  unintelligible,  it 
has,  in  course  of  time,  ceased  even  to  be  art  at  all,  and  has 
been  replaced  by  counterfeits. 
This  has  resulted  from  the  following  causes.  Universal  art 
arises  only  when  some  one  of  the  people,  having  experienced 
a  strong  emotion,  feels  the  necessity  of  transmitting  it  to 
others.  The  art  of  the  rich  classes,  on  the  other  hand, 
arises  not  from  the  artist's  inner  impulse,  but  chiefly  because 
people  of  the  upper  classes  demand  amusement  and  pay  well 
for  it.  They  demand  from  art  the  transmission  of  feelings 
that  please  them,  and  this  demand  artists  try  to  meet.  But 
it  is  a  very  difficult  task,  for  people  of  the  wealthy  classes, 
spending  their  lives  in  idleness  and  luxury,  desire  to  be 
continually  diverted  by  art;  and  art,  even  the  lowest, 
cannot  be  produced  at  will,  but  has  to  generate  spontaneously 
in  the  artist's  inner  self.  And  therefore,  to  satisfy  the 
demands  of  people  of  the  upper  classes,  artists  have  had  to 
devise  methods  of  producing  imitations  of  art.  And  such 
methods  have  been  devised. 
These  methods  are  those  of  (1)  borrowing,  (2)  imitating, 
(3)  striking  (effects),  and  (4)  interesting. 106
