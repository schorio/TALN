WHAT  IS  ART?  91 
of  the  matter  remains  the  same,  only  its  form  is  changed. 
And  so  it  is  with  this  kind  of  art.  The  subject-matter  of  the 
art  of  the  upper  classes  growing  continually  more  and  more 
limited,  it  has  come  at  last  to  this,  that  to  the  artists  of  these 
exclusive  classes  it  seems  as  if  everything  has  already  been 
said,  and  that  to  find  anything  new  to  say  is  impossible. 
And  therefore,  to  freshen  up  this  art,  they  look  out  for 
fresh  forms. 
Baudelaire  and  Verlaine  invent  such  a  new  form,  furbish 
it  up,  moreover,  with  hitherto  unused  pornographic  details, 
and — the  critics  and  the  public  of  the  upper  classes  hail 
them  as  great  writers. 
This  is  the  only  explanation  of  the  success,  not  of 
Baudelaire  and  Verlaine  only,  but  of  all  the  Decadents. 
For  instance,  there  are  poems  by  Mallarme  and  Maeterlinck 
which  have  no  meaning,  and  yet  for  all  that,  or  perhaps  on 
that  very  account,  are  printed  by  tens  of  thousands,  not 
only  in  various  publications,  but  even  in  collections  of  the 
best  works  of  the  younger  poets. 
Tliis,  for  example,  is  a  sonnet  by  Mallarme  : — 
A  la  nue  accablante  tu 
Basse  de  basalte  et  de  laves 
A  meme  les  eclws  esclaves 
Par  une  trompe  sans  vertu. 
Quel  scpulcral  naufrage  (tu 
Le  soir,  ecume,  mais  y  laves) 
Supreme  une  entre  les  tpaves 
Abolit  le  mat  devetu. 
Ou  cela  gue  furibond  faute 
De  quelque  perdition  haute 
Tout  I'abime  vain  eploye
