Kids’ visions are sewn into a brilliant quilt.
ater this century, a shopping trip to the moon
or a stay in an underwater hotel might be
possible. Perhaps alien ships will land on Earth.If this sounds like a patchwork of wild ideas,you’re right. 
The Museum of Arts and Design in New York
City challenged students to create quilt squaresdepicting their visions of life in the year 2050. Students from more than 250 schools sent in 19-inch squares in which they had stitched theirdreams of the future. Judges picked one squarefrom each state. Then, expert quilters sewed thesquares together into a12-foot-high, 22-foot-wide,three-panel quilt.
Holly Hotchner,
director of the Museum ofArts and Design, says thequilt project introducedstudents to a traditionalart form while givingthem a chance to showoff their positive, futuristicoutlook. “The squaresshow a wonderful varietyof views,” says Hotchner,“and a great vision of life.”
