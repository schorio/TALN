72 Chapter 4 Looking at ArtThe emptiness and gloom of a nation fallen
on hard times would seem like a strange themefor art. Yet, it is precisely this theme that runsthrough the works of American artist EdwardHopper. Hopper lived through a period calledthe Great Depression, a time when there wasvery little money. Many people in the UnitedStates and abroad were left without jobs orhomes. Hopper’s paintings accurately capturethe mood of the era. They show lonely, oftendesperate people in shabby, rundown rooms. 
Figure 4–8 shows one of Hopper’s best-
known paintings. Notice the point of view.
This is the angle from which the viewer sees the
scene in an artwork. Typical of Hopper’s work,
we do not see the people in this picture head-on. Instead, we are given a glimpse of themthrough a window.WHATYOUWILLLEARN
In this lesson, you will use oil pastels to
create your own Hopper “window.” Like Fig-ure 4–8, your painting will have a realisticsubject. Your point of view, like Hopper’s,will be outside, looking into a lighted roomthrough a window. It will be nighttime. Theroom will have no people. The furniture and
other contents will overlap to indicate space.These objects will be drawn to show themood or personality of the person living orworking in this room.
