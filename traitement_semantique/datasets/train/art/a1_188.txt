174 Chapter 9 Visiting PlacesThere is something magical about the
sights and sounds of the big city. Somecities, even at night, seem to give off energyand electricity. One such place is the focusof Figure 9–13. Do you recognize this city?
It is New York. One artist who fell under itsspell was a painter named John Sloan. Sloan
belonged to a group of American Realists who
worked at the beginning of the twentieth cen-tury. Because there were eight in the group,
they referred to themselves simply as The
Eight.
In their paintings, The Eight realistically
recorded the images of everyday life in the
big city. Look closely at the cityscape in Fig-ure 9–13. At its center, an elevated commutertrain roars around a curve partially hiddenby a low-rise building.WHATYOUWILLLEARN
