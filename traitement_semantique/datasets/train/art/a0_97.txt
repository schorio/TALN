54  WHAT  IS  ART? 
men  nearer  the  ideal  their  religion  indicates,  if  they  are 
in  harmony  with  it  and  do  not  contradict  it,  they  are  good ; 
if  they  estrange  men  from,  it  and  oppose  it,  they  are  bad. 
If  the  religion  places  the  meaning  of  life  in  worshipping 
one  God  and  fulfilling  what  is  regarded  as  His  will,  as  was 
the  case  among  the  Jews,  then  the  feelings  flowing  from 
love  to  that  God,  and  to  His  law,  successfully  transmitted 
through  the  art  of  poetry  by  the  prophets,  by  the  psalms,  or 
by  the  epic  of  the  book  of  Genesis,  is  good,  high  art.  All 
opposing  that,  as  for  instance  the  transmission  of  feelings 
of  devotion  to  strange  gods,  or  of  feelings  incompatible  with 
the  law  of  God,  would  be  considered  bad  art.  Or  if,  as 
was  the  case  among  the  Greeks,  the  religion  places  the 
meaning  of  life  in  earthly  happiness,  in  beauty  and  in 
strength,  then  art  successfully  transmitting  the  joy  and 
energy  of  life  would  be  considered  good  art,  but  art  which 
transmitted  feelings  of  effeminacy  or  despondency  would  be 
bad  art.  If  the  meaning  of  life  is  seen  in  the  well-being 
of  one's  nation,  or  in  honouring  one's  ancestors  and  con 
tinuing  the  mode  of  life  led  by  them,  as  was  the  case  among 
the  Romans  and  the  Chinese  respectively,  then  art  trans 
mitting  feelings  of  joy  at  sacrificing  one's  personal  well-being 
for  the  common  weal,  or  at  exalting  one's  ancestors  and 
maintaining  their  traditions,  would  be  considered  good  art ; 
but  art  expressing  feelings  contrary  to  this  would  be  regarded 
as  bad.  If  the  meaning  of  life  is  seen  in  freeing  oneself  from 
the  yoke  of  animalism,  as  is  the  case  among  the  Buddhists, 
then  art  successfully  transmitting  feelings  that  elevate  the 
soul  and  humble  the  flesh  will  be  good  art,  and  all  that 
transmits  feelings  strengthening  the  bodily  passions  will  be 
bad  art. 
In  every  age,  and  in  every  human  society,  there  exists  a 
religious  sense,  common  to  that  whole  society,  of  what  is 
good  and  what  is  bad,  and  it  is  this  religious  conception 
that  decides  the  value  of  the  feelings  transmitted  by  art.
