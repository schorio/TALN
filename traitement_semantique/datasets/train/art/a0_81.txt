CHAPTER  IV 
To  what  do  these  definitions  of  beauty  amount?  Xot 
reckoning  the  thoroughly  inaccurate  definitions  of  beauty 
which  fail  to  cover  the  conception  of  art,  and  which  suppose 
beauty  to  consist  either  in  utility,  or  in  adjustment  to  a 
purpose,  or  in  symmetry,  or  in  order,  or  in  proportion,  or  in 
smoothness,  or  in  harmony  of  the  parts,  or  in  unity  amid 
variety,  or  in  various  combinations  of  these, â€” not  reckoning 
these  unsatisfactory  attempts  at  objective  definition,  all  the 
aesthetic  definitions  of  beauty  lead  to  two  fundamental 
conceptions.  The  first  is  that  beauty  is  something  having  an 
independent  existence  (existing  in  itself),  that  it  is  one  of 
the  manifestations  of  the  absolutely  Perfect,  of  the  Idea,  of 
the  Spirit,  of  Will,  or  of  God ;  the  other  is  that  beauty  is 
a  kind  of  pleasure  received  by  us,  not  having  personal 
advantage  for  its  object. 
The  first  of  these  definitions  was  accepted  by  Fichte, 
Schelling,  Hegel,  Schopenhauer,  and  the  philosophising 
Frenchmen,  Cousin,  Jouffroy,  Ravaisson,  and  others,  not  to 
enumerate  the  second-rate  aesthetic  philosophers.  And  this 
same  objective-mystical  definition  of  beauty  is  held  by  a 
majority  of  the  educated  people  of  our  day.  It  is  a  conception 
very  widely  spread,  especially  among  the  elder  generation. 
The  second  view,  that  beauty  is  a  certain  kind  of  pleasure 
received  by  us,  not  having  personal  advantage  for  its  aim, 
finds  favour  chiefly  among  the  English  aesthetic  writers,  and  is 
shared  by  the  other  part  of  our  society,  principally  by  the 
younger  generation.
