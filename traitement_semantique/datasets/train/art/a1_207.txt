PENDANT FROM LONGAGO
An altogether different function was
served by the object in Figure 10–11 . Like the
rhyton, this pendant was fashioned entirely
from gold. A pendant is a jewelry item worn
suspended from the neck on a string or chain. No-
tice its size. For a piece of jewelry that is only2
5⁄8/H11033, the artist has managed to include an
amazing amount of detail. Study this object.It portrays a man who projects outward inhigh relief. Notice the expression on theman’s face and the direction of his gaze. Whatfeeling does this portrait communicate?

Creating an Object Design
Develop your technical skills. Imagine
that you were a goldsmith in Persia, andyou were asked to fashion a drinking
vessel. Imagine, moreover, that the
request was for an original design—something like no other drinking vesselseen before.
Complete a detailed pencil drawing of 
a cup with a handle. Make your drawinglarge enough to fill a 9 x 12-inch sheet ofwhite drawing paper. Use shading toaccent the details of your design and toemphasize its three-dimensional form.
