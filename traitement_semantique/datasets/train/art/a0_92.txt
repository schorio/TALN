WHAT  IS  ART?  49 
say,  fear  on  encountering  a  wolf,  relates  that  encounter ;  and, 
in  order  to  evoke  in  others  the  feeling  he  has  experienced, 
describes  himself,  his  condition  before  the  encounter,  the 
surroundings,  the  wood,  his  own  lightheartedness,  and  then 
the  wolf's  appearance,  its  movements,  the  distance  between 
himself  and  the  wolf,  etc.  All  this,  if  only  the  boy  when 
telling  the  story,  again  experiences  the  feelings  he  had  lived 
through  and  infects  the  hearers  and  compels  them  to  feel 
what  the  narrator  had  experienced,  is  art.  If  even  the 
boy  had  not  seen  a  wolf  but  had  frequently  been  afraid  of 
one,  and  if,  wishing  to  evoke  in  others  the  fear  he  had  felt, 
he  invented  an  encounter  with  a  wolf,  and  recounted  it  so 
as  to  make  his  hearers  share  the  feelings  he  experienced 
when  he  feared  the  wolf,  that  also  would  be  art.  And 
just  in  the  same  way  it  is  art  if  a  man,  having  experienced 
either  the  fear  of  suffering  or  the  attraction  of  enjoyment 
(whether  in  reality  or  in  imagination),  expresses  these 
feelings  on  canvas  or  in  marble  so  that  others  are  infected 
by  them.  And  it  is  also  art  if  a  man  feels  or  imagines 
to  himself  feelings  of  delight,  gladness,  sorrow,  despair, 
courage,  or  Despondency^  and  the  transition  from  one  to 
another  of  these  feelings,  and  expresses  these  feelings  by 
sounds,  so  that  the  hearers  are  infected  by  them,  and 
experience  them  as  they  were  experienced  by  the  composer. 
The  feelings  with  which  the  artist  infects  others  may  be 
most  various — very  strong  or  very  weak,  very  important  or 
very  insignificant,  very  bad  or  very  good :  feelings  of  love 
for  native  land,  self-devotion  and  submission  to  fate  or  to 
God  expressed  in  a  drama,  raptures  of  lovers  described  in 
a  novel,  feelings  of  voluptuousness  expressed  in  a  picture, 
courage  expressed  in  a  triumphal  inarch,  merriment  evoked 
by  a  dance,  humour  evoked  by  a  funny  story,  the  feeling 
of  quietness  transmitted  by  an  evening  landscape  or  by  a 
lullaby,  or  the  feeling  of  admiration  evoked  by  a  beautiful 
arabesque — it  is  all  art.
