The largest camera on Earth captures faces 
and feelings of twenty-first-century heroes.
unique camera sits
in a studio in New
York City. It is a 12-foot-
wide by 16-foot-highPolaroid. In 90 seconds,it takes color picturesthat are 40 inches wideby 106 inches high.That’s as high as anaverage room’s ceiling.
The camera was
put to use days afterSeptember 11, 2001,when terroristsdestroyed New York City’s World Trade Center towers.Photographer Joe McNally used the Polaroid to takepictures of rescue workers. He photographed firefighters,police officers, doctors, and nurses. The portraits show theworkers’ emotions and feelings since that fateful day.
At the end of the project, McNally was exhausted. He was
certain, however, that his photos would stand as a tribute to the courage and heroism of workers at Ground Zero—the siteof the disaster. “I think this might be the one significant thing I will do as a photographer,” said McNally.
