CHAPTER    XVIII 
THE  cause  of  the  lie  into  which  the  art  of  our  society  has 
fallen  was  that  people  of  the  upper  classes,  having  ceased 
to  believe  in  the  Church  teaching  (called  Christian),  did  not 
resolve  to  accept  true  Christian  teaching  in  its  real  and 
fundamental  principles  of  sonship  to  God  and  brotherhood 
to  man,  but  continued  to  live  on  without  any  belief,  en 
deavouring  to  make  up  for  the  absence  of  belief — some  by 
hypocrisy,  pretending  still  to  believe  in  the  nonsense  of  the 
Church  creeds  ;  others  by  boldly  asserting  their  disbelief  ; 
others  by  refined  agnosticism ;  and  others,  again,  by  return 
ing  to  the  Greek  worship  of  beauty,  proclaiming  egotism  to 
be  right,  and  elevating  it  to  the  rank  of  a  religious  doctrine. 
The  cause  of  the  malady  was  the  non-acceptance  of  Christ's 
teaching  in  its  real,  i.e.  its  full,  meaning.  And  the  only  cure 
for  the  illness  lies  in  acknowledging  that  teaching  in  its 
full  meaning.  And  such  acknowledgment  in  our  time  is 
not  only  possible  but  inevitable.  Already  to-day  a  man, 
standing  on  the  height  of  the  knowledge  of  our  age,  whether 
he  be  nominally  a  Catholic  or  a  Protestant,  cannot  say  that 
he  really  believes  in  the  dogmas  of  the  Church:  in  God 
being  a  Trinity,  in  Christ  being  God,  in  the  scheme  of 
redemption,  and  so  forth  •  nor  can  he  satisfy  himself  by  pro 
claiming  his  unbelief  or  scepticism,  nor  by  relapsing  into 
the  worship  of  beauty  and  egotism.  Above  all,  he  can  no 
longer  say  that  we  do  not  know  the  real  meaning  of  Christ's 
teaching.  That  meaning  has  not  only  become  accessible  to 
all  men  of  our  times,  but  the  whole  life  of  man  to-day  is
