No artist works completely alone. Artists
of each age, rather, study and learn fromworks created in ages past. The same may besaid of art historians. These are people who
study art of different ages and cultures. Like art
critics, art historians examine and analyze art.Unlike critics, art historians are not contentto look only at artworks. Their job is to lookbeyond them. They record milestones in artand changes in the way artists work.
In this chapter, you will journey back
through the ages. You will learn about some of these milestones and changes. Yourjourney will begin with a look at art of earlier times.
ART OF ANCIENT EGYPT
Have you ever followed a brook or stream
to its source? If we follow the long, twisting“stream” of art history to its source, we endup on the banks of an actual river. That riveris the Nile. The time is 5,000 years ago. Theplace is Egypt. Powerful kings called phar-aohs ruled. Farming and trade thrived. So did art.
Rules of the Egyptian Artist
The Egyptians built mighty temples and
monuments. It was with an eye toward dec-orating these structures that much of their artwas created. Study the relief carving in Fig-
ure 5–2. This work probably once graced a
pharaoh’s tomb. The subject is the Egyptiangod of learning. The figure has a human bodyand the head of a bird, specifically an ibis.
