FIGURE PAINTING
The recording of figures in action is not
limited to drawing. Many painters try to cap-ture action in their work.
Edgar Degas often depicted his subjects in
natural, active poses. In Figure 8–7 you see a
backstage ballet scene. Notice how he has useddiagonal movement to depict the arms, legs,and torsos of the dancers. No one is standingstraight and stiff. Everyone looks alive andready to dance off the background. In this
work, his technique of leaving the strokes ofthe pastel unblended adds to the movementand excitement.

Edgar Degas (1834–1917)
Cultural connection. You may know that
Degas is famous for his paintings of balletdancers, but did you also know that hestudied to be a lawyer? Born in Paris to awealthy family in 1834, Degas studied law
for a short time before discovering his
interest in painting.
To pursue a career in art, he trained at
the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and trav-eled widely to find inspiration. Influenced byphotography and Japanese prints, Degasused many innovative compositions in hisartwork. His themes dealt with people andcity life, especially ballet dancers at the theater (see Figure 8–7 ).
After 1909, Degas turned to sculpture
due to failing eyesight. He left many waxmodels of dancers and horses that werecast into bronze after his death.
