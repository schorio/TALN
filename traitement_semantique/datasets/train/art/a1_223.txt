RECENT EVENTS
The tragedy of September 11, 2001, moved
some art students in Houston, Texas to exer-cise their freedom of expression as Americans.They spoke loudly and vividly in the lan-guage of art as they created The Eleventh Day
(Figure 11–7 ), a 12 x 30-foot mural on canvas.
Angry and confused over the events of
9/11, students were encouraged to expresstheir feelings through art, by drawing andpainting what they felt. They were inspired byPicasso’s painting Guernica, as an example of
how artists express their anger and frustra-tions over events they cannot control. The stu-dents chose to use the language of art to speaktheir thoughts, feelings, hopes, and dreams inresponse to the nation's tragedy. What feelings
or mood does this mural convey?
