WHAT  IS  ART  ?  137 
commencements  are  so  short,  so  encumbered  with  complica 
tions  of  harmony  and  orchestration  and  with  effects  of  con 
trast,  are  so  obscure  and  unfinished,  and  what  is  happening 
on  the  stage  meanwhile  is  so  abominably  false,  that  it  is 
difficult  even  to  perceive  these  musical  snatches,  let  alone  to 
be  infected  by  them.  Above  all,  from  the  very  beginning 
to  the  very  end,  and  in  each  note,  the  author's  purpose  is  so audible  and  visible,  that  one  sees  and  hears  neither  Siegfried 
nor  the  birds,  but  only  a  limited,  self-opinionated  German 
of  bad  taste  and  bad  style,  who  has  a  most  false  conception  of 
poetry,  and  who,  in  the  rudest  and  most  primitive  manner, 
wishes  to  transmit  to  me  these  false  and  mistaken  con 
ceptions  of  his. 
Everyone  knows  the  feeling  of  distrust  and  resistance 
which  is  always  evoked  by  an  author's  evident  predeter mination.  A  narrator  need  only  say  in  advance,  Prepare 
to  cry  or  to  laugh,  and  you  are  sure  neither  to  cry  nor  to 
laugh.  But  when  you  see  that  an  author  prescribes  emotion 
at  what  is  not  touching  but  only  laughable  or  disgusting, 
.and  when  you  see,  moreover,  that  the  author  is  fully  assured 
that  he  has  captivated  you,  a  painfully  tormenting  feeling 
results,  similar  to  what  one  would  feel  if  an  old,  deformed 
woman  put  on  a  ball-dress  and  smilingly  coquetted  before 
you,  confident  of  your  approbation.  This  impression  was 
strengthened  by  the  fact  that  around  me  I  saw  a  crowd  of 
three  thousand  people,  who  not  only  patiently  witnessed  all 
this  absurd  nonsense,  but  even  considered  it  their  duty  to  be 
delighted  with  it. 
I  somehow  managed  to  sit  out  the  next  scene  also,  in 
which  the  monster  appears,  to  the  accompaniment  of  his 
bass  notes  intermingled  with  the  motiv  of  Siegfried;  but 
after  the  fight  with  the  monster,  and  all  the  roars,  fires,  and 
sword-wavings,  I  could  stand  no  more  of  it,  and  escaped  from 
the  theatre  with  a  feeling  of  repulsion  which,  even  now,  I 
â€¢cannot  forget.
