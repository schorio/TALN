CHAPTER   XIY 
I  KNOW  that  most  men — not  only  those  considered  clever, 
but  even  those  who  are  very  clever  and  capable  of 
understanding  most  difficult  scientific,  mathematical  or 
philosophic  problems — can  very  seldom  discern  even  the 
simplest  and  most  obvious  truth  if  it  be  such  as  to  oblige 
them  to  admit  the  falsity  of  conclusions  they  have  formed, 
perhaps  with  much  difficulty — conclusions  of  which  they 
are  proud,  which  they  have  taught  to  others,  and  on  which 
they  have  built  their  lives.  And  therefore  I  have  little 
hope  that  what  I  adduce  as  to  the  perversion  of  art  and 
taste  in  our  society  will  be  accepted  or  even  seriously 
considered.  Nevertheless,  I  must  state  fully  the  inevitable 
conclusion  to  which  my  investigation  into  the  question  of 
art  has  brought  me.  This  investigation  has  brought  me  to 
the  conviction  that  almost  all  that  our  society  considers  to 
be  art,  good  art,  and  the  whole  of  art,  far  from  being  real 
and  good  art,  and  the  whole  of  art,  is  not  even  art  at  all, 
but  only  a  counterfeit  of  it.  This  position,  I  know,  will 
seem  very  strange  and  paradoxical ;  but  if  we  once  acknow 
ledge  art  to  be  a  human  activity  by  means  of  which  some 
people  transmit  their  feelings  to  others  (and  not  a  service 
of  Beauty,  nor  a  manifestation  of  the  Idea,  and  so  forth),  we 
shall  inevitably  have  to  admit  this  further  conclusion  also. 
If  it  is  true  that  art  is  an  activity  by  means  of  which  one 
man  having  experienced  a  feeling  intentionally  transmits  it 
to  others,  then  we  have  inevitably  to  admit  further,  that  of 
all  that  among  us  is  termed  the  art  of  the  upper  classes — of  all 143
