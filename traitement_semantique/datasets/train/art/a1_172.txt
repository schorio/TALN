In the previous lesson, you viewed art
based on several heroes. Figure 8–16 contains
yet another such work. Do you recognize thehero in this painting? It is Joan of Arc. Joan ofArc lived in France in the 1400s. She was notmuch older than you when she bravely ledan army of French troops against the English. 
Look closely at Figure 8–16. The picture
is filled with figures and action. Even so, Joanis easily identified. She is mounted on a whitecharger and carries a huge banner. 
WHATYOUWILLLEARN
In this lesson, you will create your own
banner honoring a hero. Your banner, whichwill use mixed media, may focus on a real-lifeor made-up hero. The work will be divided
