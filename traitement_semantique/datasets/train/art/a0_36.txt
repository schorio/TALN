THIS  book  of  mine,  "What  is  Art?"  appears  now  for  the first  time  in  its  true  form.  More  than  one  edition  has 
already  been  issued  in  Russia,  but  in  each  case  it  has  been 
so  mutilated  by  the  "Censor,"  that  I  request  all  who  are 
interested  in  my  views  on  art  only  to  judge  of  them  by 
the  work  in  its  present  shape.  The  causes  which  led  to 
the  publication  of  the  book — with  my  name  attached  to 
it — in  a  mutilated  form,  were  the  following : — In  accord 
ance  with  a  decision  I  arrived  at  long  ago, — not  to  submit 
my  writings  to  the  "  Censorship "  (which  I  consider  to  be 
an  immoral  and  irrational  institution),  but  to  print  them 
only  in  the  shape  in  which  they  were  written, — I  intended 
not  to  attempt  to  print  this  work  in  Russia.  However, 
my  good  acquaintance  Professor  Grote,  editor  of  a  Moscow 
psychological  magazine,  having  heard  of  the  contents  of  my 
work,  asked  me  to  print  it  in  his  magazine,  and  promised 
me  that  he  would  get  the  book  through  the  "  Censor's " 
office  unmutilated  if  I  would  but  agree  to  a  few  very 
unimportant  alterations,  merely  toning  down  certain  ex 
pressions.  I  was  weak  enough  to  agree  to  this,  and  it 
has  resulted  in  a  book  appearing,  under  my  name,  from 
which  not  only  have  some  essential  thoughts  been  excluded, 
but  into  which  the  thoughts  of  other  men — even  thoughts 
utterly  opposed  to  my  own  convictions — have  been  intro duced.
