Whether a place is outdoors or inside, public or
private, one thing is sure:To reach it requiresfollowing a road or path. Roads and paths are not
only a means to an end.They can be an adventureall to themselves. Consider as an example thecountry lane in the picture in Figure 9–4. Notice
that the main road shown stretches as far as theeye can see. Let your mind wander as you glimpse
this enchanting rural scene.Where does this roadlead? What will be waiting there when you arrive?Where will you end up if you turn left? If you turnright? The artist used his imagination in creating
this picture. He leaves it to viewers to use their ownimagination to answer questions like these.
