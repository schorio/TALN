artist’s native Honduras. Notice how plants,trees, and the stone fence bordering the pathare painted rhythmically as repeated shapesand textures. Despite being stylized, the workinvites the viewer in for a stroll toward thetown. Look carefully. The painting is orga-nized so as to lead your eye to the center ofinterest. Can you identify that center of in-terest? What elements and principles of artare used to help draw your eye to it?WHATYOUWILLLEARN
You will make a nature scene of a familiar
place that you know well or have recentlyvisited. You will begin by collecting small nat-ural objects to make an assemblage (ah-sem-
blahzh ). This means a three-dimensional
artwork consisting of many pieces assembled together. You will also use markers and oil
pastels to draw other objects and details. Todo this, you will organize your work to cre-ate a center of interest. You will emphasizethe most important part of the scene usinglines, shapes, colors, and textures.
