The Renaissance, you have learned, was
a time of bold new discoveries. One of thesewas a technique called linear perspective. This
technique aided painters in their quest  forrealism. In linear perspective, the horizontal
lines of objects are slanted. This makes themappear to extend back into space. As Figure
5–14 shows, the lines meet at an imaginary
point called the vanishing point.
The painting in Figure 5–15 uses linear
perspective. Examine this lifelike work. Findthe slanted lines in the vine-covered lattice-work above the dancers. Try extending theselines with your finger. At what point in thepainting do they come together? Where elsein the work has the artist used slanted lines?What other techniques has he relied upon tocreate a sense of depth?
WHATYOUWILLLEARN
Linear perspective is used to lend a feel-
ing of space to two-dimensional works. In thislesson, you will create a three-dimensionalwork of art that uses both real and suggested
space. You will use a variety of items to cre-ate a diorama (dy-uh- ram-uh). This is a scenic
representation in which miniature sculptures and
other objects are displayed against a painted back-drop. You will create a sense of deep space
through changes in hue, value, and intensity.
