CHAPTEE   XII 
IN  our  society  three  conditions  co-operate  to  cause  the  pro 
duction  of  objects  of  counterfeit  art.  They  are — (1)  the 
considerable  remuneration  of  artists  for  their  productions 
and  the  professionalisation  of  artists  which  this  has  pro 
duced,  (2)  art  criticism,  and  (3)  schools  of  art. 
While  art  was  as  yet  undivided,  and  only  religious  art 
was  valued  and  rewarded  while  indiscriminate  art  was 
left  unrewarded,  there  were  no  counterfeits  of  art, 
or,  if  any  existed,  being  exposed  to  the  criticism  of  the 
whole  people,  they  quickly  disappeared.  But  as  soon  as 
that  division  occurred,  and  the  upper  classes  acclaimed 
every  kind  of  art  as  good  if  only  it  afforded  them  pleasure, 
and  began  to  reward  such  art  more  highly  than  any  other 
social  activity,  immediately  a  large  number  of  people  devoted 
themselves  to  this  activity,  and  art  assumed  quite  a  different 
character  and  became  a  profession. 
And  as  soon  as  this  occurred,  the  chief  and  most  precious 
quality  of  art — its  sincerity — was  at  once  greatly  weakened 
and  eventually  quite  destroyed. 
The  professional  artist  lives  by  his  art,  and  has  continually 
to  invent  subjects  for  his  works,  and  does  invent  them. 
And  it  is  obvious  how  great  a  difference  must  exist  between 
works  of  art  produced  on  the  one  hand  by  men  such  as 
the  Jewish  prophets,  the  authors  of  the  Psalms,  Francis  of 
Assisi,  the  authors  of  the  Iliad  and  Odyssey,  of  folk-stories, 
legends,  and  folk-songs,  many  of  whom  not  only  received 
no  remuneration  for  their  work,  but  did  not  even  attach 118
