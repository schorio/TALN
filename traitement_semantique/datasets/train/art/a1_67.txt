Rome c. 50 B.C.
Historical connection. The world of ancient
Rome could be a raw and uncivilized place.On Roman holidays, the public was oftentreated to free entertainment in amphi-theaters, which were outdoor arenas. Thisentertainment, however, was often veryviolent. One popular event involved gladi-ators. These gladiators were often slaves orcriminals, fighting each other to the death.During the rule of Julius Caesar, theseexhibitions involved 300 pairs of gladiators.
However, not all forms of entertainment
were this violent. Watching chariot races
was a popular pastime in ancient Rome.
Many Roman citizens also enjoyed going 
to the theatre to see comedies, dramas,mimes, or pantomimes. Figure 3–14 shows
an ancient Roman sculpture of a boxer.To this day, boxing remains a popular
spectator sport.
