CHAPTER  X 
IN  consequence  of  their  unbelief  the  art  of  the  upper  classes 
became  poor  in  subject-matter.  But  besides  that,  becoming 
continually  more  and  more  exclusive,  it  became  at  the 
same  time  continually  more  and  more  involved,  aifected,  and 
obscure. 
When  a  universal  artist  (such  as  were  some  of  the  Grecian 
artists  or  the  Jewish  prophets)  composed  his  work,  he  naturally 
strove  to  say  what  he  had  to  say  in  such  a  manner  that  his 
production  should  be  intelligible  to  all  men.  But  when  an 
artist  composed  for  a  small  circle  of  people  placed  in  excep 
tional  conditions,  or  even  for  a  single  individual  and  his 
courtiers, — for  popes,  cardinals,  kings,  dukes,  queens,  or  for  a 
king's  mistress, — he  naturally  only  aimed  at  influencing  these 
people,  who  were  well  known  to  him,  and  lived  in  excep 
tional  conditions  familiar  to  him.  And  this  was  an  easier 
task,  and  the  artist  Avas  involuntarily  drawn  to  express 
himself  by  allusions  comprehensible  only  to  the  initiated, 
and  obscure  to  everyone  else.  In  the  first  place,  more  could 
be  said  in  this  way  ;  and  secondly,  there  is  (for  the  initiated) 
even  a  certain  charm  in  the  cloudiness  of  such  a  manner  of 
expression.  This  method,  which  showed  itself  both  in 
euphemism  and  in  mythological  and  historical  allusions, 
came  more  and  more  into  use,  until  it  has,  apparently,  at 
last  reached  its  utmost  limits  in  the  so-called  art  of  the 
Decadents.  It  has  come,  finally,  to  this  :  that  not  only  is 
haziness,  mysteriousness,  obscurity,  and  exclusiveness  (shut 
ting  out  the  masses)  elevated  to  the  rank  of  a  merit  and  a
