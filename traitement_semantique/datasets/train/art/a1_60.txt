46 Chapter 3 Art Media and TechniquesWhen they hear the term art,many people
think of paintings. This is not unreasonablewhen you consider that the first artists werepainters. They produced their “artworks” onthe walls of caves some 15,000 years ago.They made paint from crushed rocks mixedwith animal fat or blood.
Since that time, many new painting media
have appeared. In this lesson, you will learnabout some of these.PAINT
Although paints have changed over the
centuries, the way of making them has not.Like paints used by early cave artists, thosetoday contain three main ingredients:
●Pigment. Pigment is a finely ground powder
that gives paint its color. The pigment that
cave artists relied on came from mineralsin rocks. Through the mid-1800s, artistscontinued to grind their own pigments.
