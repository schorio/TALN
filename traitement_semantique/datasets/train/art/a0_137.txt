94  WHAT  IS  ART? 
Et  s'il  m'interroge  encore Sans  me  reconnaitre  ? 
Parlez-lui  comme  une  soeur, 
II  souffre  peut-etre  .   .  . 
Et  s'il  veut  savoir  pourquoi La  salle  est  deserte  ? 
Montrez  lui  la  lampe  t'teinte 
Et  la  porte  ouverte  .  .  -1

Who  went  out  ?  Who  came  in  ?  Who  is  speaking  ?  Who 
died? 
I  beg  the  reader  to  be  at  the  pains  of  reading  through 
the  samples  I  cite  in  Appendix  II.  of  the  celebrated  and 
esteemed  young  poets — Griffin,  Verhaeren,  More"as,  and Montesquieu.  It  is  important  to  do  so  in  order  to  form  a 
clear  conception  of  the  present  position  of  art,  and  not  to 
suppose,  as  many  do,  that  Decadentism  is  an  accidental  and 
transitory  phenomenon.  To  avoid  the  reproach  of  having 
selected  the  worst  verses,  I  have  copied  out  of  each  volume 
the  poem  which  happened  to  stand  on  page  28. 
All  the  other  productions  of  these  poets  are  equally  un 
intelligible,  or  can  only  be  understood  with  great  difficulty, 
and  then  not  fully.  All  the  productions  of  those  hundreds 
of  poets,  of  whom  I  have  named  a  few,  are  the  same  in  kind. 
And  among  the  Germans,  Swedes,  Norwegians,  Italians,  and 
us  Russians,  similar  verses  are  printed.  And  such  produc 
tions  are  printed  and  made  up  into  book  form,  if  not  by  the 
million,  then  by  the  hundred  thousand  (some  of  these  works 
sell  in  tens  of  thousands).  For  type-setting,  paging,  printing, 
and  binding  these  books,  millions  and  millions  of  working 
days  are  spent — not  less,  I  think,  than  went  to  build  the
