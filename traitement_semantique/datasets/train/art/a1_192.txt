178 Chapter 9 Visiting PlacesYou have examined panoramic views of
land and of water. The painting in Figure
9–17 gives you two vistas in one. In the near
distance, just below the hill on which theviewer is standing, is a city—Genoa, Italy.Beyond is a stretch of sea rippling and shim-mering in the sunlight. Notice how thestrong Mediterranean sun glints off the starkwhite houses. What do you think it wouldbe like to visit this combined city-seascapein person? Do you think cooling breezesfrom the sea might counter the noondayheat?
In making this painting, the artist faced a
challenge. That challenge was capturing thedazzling effects of bright sunlight and its re-flected light on a clear summer day. In thislesson, you will face a similar challenge.WHATYOUWILLLEARN
