looks real enough to touch. Yet, a viewer
touching the surface would feel no suchfacets. The surface instead would feel flat. Itwould also feel slightly grainy rather thansmooth. This is because the work was doneon canvas, a coarse material. 
This painting makes use of visual texture.
We “feel” the texture with our eyes. Look
back at the realistic street scene in Figure 1–17on page 17. How many different textures has the artist recorded? Which of these wouldfeel smooth? 
Lesson 7 Texture 21/rhombus6Figure 1–21 Analyze the use of color and texture in
this work. Notice the work’s title and size. Why might theartist have made the sculpture so large?

Making Rubbings for Texture
Practical applications. Explore your
classroom and the school grounds forobjects with uneven, hard textures.Thesemight include coarse stones and grainywood. Gather several different surfaces.
Place a sheet of drawing paper overeach. Using the side of an unwrappedcrayon, do a rubbing of each surface.Press down just hard enough to capturethe texture.
Use the best of your rubbings as the
basis for a still life. Refer to the sketch youdid in Lesson 6. For this still life, however,cut the shape of each object from one ofyour rubbings.Try several arrangements
of visual textures before you glue thepieces in place. Decide whether you needareas of solid color. If so, add these.
PORTFOLIO 
Write a short paragraph describing in
detail a variety of practical applicationsfor design ideas. Which rubbings made
for better texture? For what else can you
use these textures? Put this paragraphin your portfolio with the still life.
