50  WHAT  IS  ART? 
If  only  the  spectators  or  auditors  are  infected  by  the 
feelings  which  the  author  has  felt,  it  is  art. 
To  evoke  in  oneself  a  feeling  one  has  once  experienced,  and 
having  evoked  it  in  oneself,  then,  by  means  of  movements,  lines, 
colours,  sounds,  or  forms  expressed  in  ivords,  so  to  transmit 
that  feeling  that  others  may  experience  the  same  feeling â€” 
this  is  the  activity  of  art. 
Art  is  a  human  activity,  consisting  in  this,  that  one  man 
consciously,  by  means  of  certain  external  signs,  hands  on  to 
others  feelings  he  has  lived  through,  and  that  other  people 
are  infected  by  these  feelings,  and  also  experience  them. 
Art  is  not,  as  the  metaphysicians  say,  the  manifestation 
of  some  mysterious  Idea  of  beauty,  or  God ;  it  is  not,  as  the 
sesthetical  physiologists  say,  a  game  in  which  man  lets  off  his 
excess  of  stored-up  energy ;  it  is  not  the  expression  of  man's 
emotions  by  external  signs;  it  is  not  the  production  of 
pleasing  objects ;  and,  above  all,  it  is  not  pleasure  ;  but  it  is 
a  means  of  union  among  men,  joining  them  together  in  the 
same  feelings,  and  indispensable  for  the  life  and  progress 
towards  well-being  of  individuals  and  of  humanity. 
As,  thanks  to  man's  capacity  to  express  thoughts  by  words, 
every  man  may  know  all  that  has  been  done  for  him  in  the 
realms  of  thought  by  all  humanity  before  his  day,  and  can,  in 
the  present,  thanks  to  this  capacity  to  understand  the  thoughts 
of  others,  become  a  sharer  in  their  activity,  and  can  himself 
hand  on  to  his  contemporaries  and  descendants  the  thoughts 
he  has  assimilated  from  others,  as  well  as  those  which  have 
arisen  within  himself;  so,  thanks  to  man's  capacity  to  be 
infected  with  the  feelings  of  others  by  means  of  art,  all  that 
is  being  lived  through  by  his  contemporaries  is  accessible  to 
him,  as  well  as  the  feelings  experienced  by  men  thousands  of 
years  ago,  and  he  has  also  the  possibility  of  transmitting  his 
own  feelings  to  others. 
If  people  lacked  this  capacity  to  receive  the  thoughts 
conceived  by  the  men  who  preceded  them,  and  to  pass  on  to
