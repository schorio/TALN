xx  INTRODUCTION. 
larger  number  of  people  live  on  the  verge  of  starvation ; 
the  condition  of  the  factory-hands  is  much  worse  than 
in  England,  and  there  are  many  glaring  cases  of  brutal 
cruelty  inflicted  on  the  peasants  by  the  officials,  the  police, 
or  the  military, — but  in  Russia  a  far  greater  proportion  of 
the  population  live  in  the  country,  and  a  peasant  usually 
has  his  own  house,  and  tills  his  share  of  the  communal 
lands.  The  "unperverted  country  peasant"  of  whom 
Tolstoy  speaks  is  a  man  who  perhaps  suffers  grievous 
want  when  there  is  a  bad  harvest  in  his  province,  but 
he  is  a  man  accustomed  to  the  experiences  of  a  natural 
life,  to  the  management  of  his  own  affairs,  and  to  a 
real  voice  in  the  arrangements  of  the  village  commune. 
The  Government  interferes,  from  time  to  time,  to  collect 
its  taxes  by  force,  to  take  the  young  men  for  soldiers,  or 
to  maintain  the  "  rights  "  of  the  upper  classes ;  but  other 
wise  the  peasant  is  free  to  do  what  he  sees  to  be  necessary 
and  reasonable.  On  the  other  hand,  English  labourers 
are,  for  the  most  part,  not  so  poor,  they  have  more  legal 
rights,  and  they  have  votes;  but  a  far  larger  number  of 
them  live  in  towns  and  are  engaged  in  unnatural  occupa 
tions,  while  even  those  that  do  live  in  touch  with  nature 
are  usually  mere  wage-earners,  tilling  other  men's  land, 
and  living  often  in  abject  submission  to  the  farmer,  the 
parson,  or  the  lady-bountiful.  They  are  dependent  on 
an  employer  for  daily  bread,  and  the  condition  of  a  wage- 
labourer  is  as  unnatural  as  that  of  a  landlord. 
The  tyranny  of  the  St.  Petersburg  bureaucracy  is  more 
dramatic,  but  less  omnipresent — and  probably  far  less  fatal  to 
the  capacity  to  enjoy  art — than  the  tyranny  of  our  respectable, 
self-satisfied,  and  property-loving  middle-class.  I  am  there 
fore  afraid  that  we  have  no  great  number  of  "unperverted  " 
country  labourers  to  compare  with  those  of  whom  Tolstoy 
speaks — and  some  of  whom  I  have  known  personally. 
But  the  truth  Tolstoy  elucidates  lies  far  too  deep  in
