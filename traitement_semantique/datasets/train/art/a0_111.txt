68  WHAT  IS  ART? 
century ;  but  since  the  upper  classes  of  European  society, 
having  lost  faith  in  the  Church  teaching,  did  not  accept  real 
Christianity  but  remained  without  any  faith,  one  can  110 
longer  speak  of  an  art  of  the  Christian  nations  in  the  sense 
of  the  whole  of  art.  Since  the  upper  classes  of  the  Christian 
nations  lost  faith  in  Church  Christianity,  the  art  of  those 
upper  classes  has  separated  itself  from  the  art  of  the  rest  of 
the  people,  and  there  have  been  two  arts — the  art  of  the 
people  and  genteel  art.  And  therefore  the  answer  to  the 
question  how  it  could  occur  that  humanity  lived  for  a 
certain  period  without  real  art,  replacing  it  by  art  which 
served  enjoyment  only,  is,  that  not  all  humanity,  nor  even 
any  considerable  portion  of  it,  lived  without  real  art,  but 
only  the  highest  classes  of  European  Christian  society,  and 
even  they  only  for  a  comparatively  short  time — from  the 
commencement  of  the  Renaissance  down  to  our  own  day. 
And  the  consequence  of  this  absence  of  true  art  showed 
itself,  inevitably,  in  the  corruption  of  that  class  which 
nourished  itself  on  the  false  art.  All  the  confused,  unin 
telligible  theories  of  art,  all  the  false  and  contradictory 
judgments  on  art,  and  particularly  the  self-confident  stagna 
tion  of  our  art  in  its  false  path,  all  arise  from  the  assertion, 
which  has  come  into  common  use  and  is  accepted  as  an 
unquestioned  truth,  but  is  yet  amazingly  and  palpably  false, 
the  assertion,  namely,  that  the  art  of  our  upper  classes l  is 
the  whole  of  art,  the  true,  the  only,  the  universal  art.  And 
although  this  assertion  (which  is  precisely  similar  to  the 
assertion  made  by  religious  people  of  the  various  Churches 
who  consider  that  theirs  is  the  only  true  religion)  is  quite 
arbitrary  and  obviously  unjust,  yet  it  is  calmly  repeated  by 
all  the  people  of  our  circle  with  full  faith  in  its  infallibility. 
1  The  contrast  made  is  between  the  classes  and  the  masses : 
between  those  who  do  not  and  those  who  do  earn  their  bread  by 
productive  manual  labour ;  the  middle  classes  being  taken  as  an 
offshoot  of  the  upper  classes. — Trans.
