An oversized sculpture
honors a famous explorer .
t is an old tradition that shipwrecked sailors would write
messages and stick them into corked bottles. They would
toss their bottled notes into the water, hoping their calls for
rescue would float ashore and bring help.
Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen have turned
this seafaring tradition into a BIG work of art. These two
artists are famous for their huge sculptures of everyday
objects that play with our expected sense of proportion.
Most viewers are at first surprised—and then
impressed—by the team’s oversized artworks,
such as their 40-foot-high sculpture of
a bottle. The looming, tilted artwork
lightheartedly honors James Cook(1728–1779). He was the British sailorand explorer who sailed around theworld twice.
The 40-foot-tall Bottle of Notes is
located in Cook’s birthplace, Middles-brough, England. The bottle is madeof giant steel script. The words form aquote from Cook’s journals. Oldenburgsays the bottle should look as if it were“stuck in the sand by a wave.” Yes, but
is there a note inside that reads “Help”?

• Use your school’s media resource center to look at
examples of work by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje 
van Bruggen. From your research, identify the “every-day” objects they have enlarged into sculptures andthe materials needed to produce these works of art.
•Write a list of your ideas for a common-object sculp-
ture for your school. Explain in a written report yourreasons for choosing that object. Describe the ma-
terials you’ll need to create your enlarged sculpture.
