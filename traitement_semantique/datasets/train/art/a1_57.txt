Keeping a Sketchbook
Develop perception. One way in which
artists develop perception is by keeping asketchbook. Many artists carry a sketch-book to record interesting scenes andobjects.
Begin a sketchbook of your own to
illustrate themes from direct observation,personal experience, and traditionalevents. Use your sketchbook to sharpen
your drawing skills and perception. The
more you draw, the better you will “see”objects.
