xvi  INTRODUCTION. 
art  "if  a  man  infects  others  directly,  immediately,  at  the  very 
time  he  experiences  the  feeling;  if  he  causes  another  man 
to  yawn  when  he  himself  cannot  help  yawning,"  etc.  Art 
begins  when  some  one,  with  the  object  of  making  others  share 
his  feeling^  expresses  his  feeling  by  certain  external  indica 
tions. 
Normal  human  beings  possess  this  faculty  to  be  infected 
by  the  expression  of  another  man's  emotions.  For  a  plain 
man  of  unperverted  taste,  living  in  contact  with  nature, 
with  animals,  and  with  his  fellow-men — say,  for  "a  country 
peasant  of  unperverted  taste,  this  is  as  easy  as  it  is  for 
an  animal  of  unspoilt  scent  to  follow  the  trace  he  needs." 
And  he  will  know  indubitably  whether  a  work  presented 
to  him  does,  or  does  not,  unite  him  in  feeling  with  the 
author.  But  very  many  people  "of  our  circle"  (upper 
and  middle  class  society)  live  such  unnatural  lives,  in 
such  conventional  relations  to  the  people  around  them, 
and  in  such  artificial  surroundings,  that  they  have  lost 
"that  simple  feeling,  that  sense  of  infection  with  another's 
feeling  —  compelling  us  to  joy  in  another's  gladness,  to 
sorrow  in  another's  grief,  and  to  mingle  souls  with  another 
— which  is  the  essence  of  art."  Such  people,  therefore,  have 
no  inner  test  by  which  to  recognise  a  work  of  art;  and  they 
will  always  be  mistaking  other  things  for  art,  and  seeking 
for  external  guides,  such  as  the  opinions  of  "recognised 
authorities."  Or  they  will  mistake  for  art  something  that 
produces  a  merely  physiological  effect — lulling  or  exciting 
them;  or  some  intellectual  puzzle  that  gives  them  some 
thing  to  think  about. 
But  if  most  people  of  the  "cultured  crowd"  are  im 
pervious  to  true  art,  is  it  really  possible  that  a  common 
Russian  country  peasant,  for  instance,  whose  work-days  are 
filled  with  agricultural  labour,  and  whose  brief  leisure  is 
largely  taken  up  by  his  family  life  and  by  his  participation 
in  the  affairs  of  the  village  commune — is  it  possible  that  he
