The word earth has two meanings. It is 
the name of the planet we live on and alsoanother word for “land.” Yet, land accountsfor only 30 percent of Earth’s surface. The restis given over to a mysterious world with itsown special population, the world of water—the rivers, lakes, and oceans.
Like creatures of the land, the animals of
this special environment have long held a fas-cination for artists.
EARLYART OF SEAANIMALS
Ancient Egypt, which you learned about
in Lesson 1, was one of the first great civi-lizations to create many kinds of art. Anotherearly people who invented numerous artforms were the Chinese.The jar shown in Figure 7–6 is described
as “blue-and-white ware.” It is made ofporcelain (por-suh-lihn), a fine-grained, high-
quality form of pottery. Porcelain is very hard to
work with because it is a very stiff clay. TheChinese perfected work in this medium dur-ing the 1300s. It was around that time thatthis jar was made.
The jar is notable not only for its craft. It
is also important because of the design on itssurface. The design shows a fish in its naturalenvironment.
Notice the attention to detail shown in
this jar. You can easily find the fish’s mouth,eye, gills, and other body features. The fish isshown surrounded by water lilies and otherwater plants. The artist appears to have beenquite familiar with these freshwater plants.
