Have you ever looked at a familiar object
under a microscope or magnifying glass?Maybe you have seen the “rivers” that criss-cross the surface of human skin. Perhaps youdiscovered that grains of table salt, far fromshapeless forms, are perfect cubes!
When seen up close, the world reveals
many surprises. Artists have long knownthis. Many have recorded insect’s-eye viewsof nature. In this lesson, you will see some of these.NATURE STUDIES
The art of drawing serves several pur-
poses. One of these is to help artists improveperception—how they “see” objects. Anotheris to make studies. A study is a drawing used
to plan a painting or other large project. The art-
work in Figure 6–6 was created with both
purposes in mind. The work is an exampleof a nature study. This is a drawing used to
help artists sharpen their perception of naturalobjects.
