WHATYOUWILLLEARN
You will make an elevation of a house like
the one in Figure 9–8. An elevation is a draw-
ing of an outside view of a building. Your eleva-
tion will show the façade (fuh- sahd ). This is
the front of a building. In your design, you will
include a porch and other features of thehouse. You will use a combination of linesand shapes to decorate the surfaces. Finally,you will make a decorative border for yourdrawing with cut geometric shapes. These
will follow a regular rhythm, which is ex-plained in Chapter 2, page 33.

the stuff of fairy tales, think again. The build-ings in Figures 9–8 and 9–9 both look as
though they might be made of gingerbread.Yet, both are real structures, made of hard
materials. The house in Figure 9–8 representsa style of architecture popular in the 1800s.The building with the onion-shaped domesis even older. It was built in the city ofMoscow in Russia during the 1500s. Thestructure was a cathedral and has now beenturned into a museum. Creating a Fanciful Exterior
