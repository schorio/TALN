28 Chapter 2 The Principles of ArtThink about masks you have seen or
worn. What kind of balance does the mask inFigure 2–4 show? In many cultures, masks
are made from available materials and haveformal balance to express the idea, mood, andpurpose of the mask. The Yaware people ofAfrica created the mask shown in Figure 2–4.
It was carved from wood that was polished toa high sheen. Notice the arrangement, tex-tures, and kinds of shapes the artist used forfacial features and details on the mask. Someshapes are geometric while others are free-form. Can you find examples of each?
