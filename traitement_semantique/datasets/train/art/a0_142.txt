WHAT  IS  ART?  99 
not  understand  and  do  not  like  what  I  consider  undoubtedly 
good  because  they  are  not  sufficiently  developed,  then  I 
have  no  right  to  deny  that  perhaps  the  reason  why  I  can 
not  understand  and  cannot  like  the  new  productions  of 
art,  is  merely  that  I  am  still  insufficiently  developed  to 
understand  them.  If  I  have  a  right  to  say  that  I,  and  the 
majority  of  people  who  are  in  sympathy,  with  me,  do  not 
understand  the  productions  of  the  new  art  simply  because 
there  is  nothing  in  it  to  understand  and  because  it  is  bad 
art,  then,  with  just  the  same  right,  the  still  larger  majority,, 
the  whole  labouring  mass,  who  do  not  understand  what  I 
consider  admirable  art,  can  say  that  what  I  reckon  as  good 
art  is  bad  art,  and  there  is  nothing  in  it  to  understand. 
I  once  saw  the  injustice  of  such  condemnation  of  the  new 
art  with  especial  clearness,  when,  in  my  presence,  a  certain 
poet,  who  writes  incomprehensible  verses,  ridiculed  incom 
prehensible  music  with  gay  self-assurance ;  and,  shortly  after 
wards,  a  certain  musician,  who  composes  incomprehensible 
symphonies,  laughed  at  incomprehensible  poetry  with  equal 
self-confidence.  I  have  no  right,  and  no  authority,  to 
condemn  the  new  art  on  the  ground  that  I  (a  man  educated 
in  the  first  half  of  the  century)  do  not  understand  it ;  I  can 
only  say  that  it  is  incomprehensible  to  me.  The  only 
advantage  the  art  I  acknowledge  has  over  the  Decadent 
art,  lies  in  the  fact  that  the  art  I  recognise  is  comprehensible' 
to  a  somewhat  larger  number  of  people  than  the  present- 
day  art. 
The  fact  that  I  am  accustomed  to  a  certain  exclusive  art, 
and  can  understand  it,  but  am  unable  to  understand 
another  still  more  exclusive  art,  does  not  give  me  a  right  to 
conclude  that  my  art  is  the  real  true  art,  and  that  the  other 
one,  which  I  do  not  understand,  is  an  unreal,  a  bad  art.  I 
can  only  conclude  that  art,  becoming  ever  more  and  more 
exclusive,  has  become  more  and  more  incomprehensible  to 
an  ever-increasing  number  of  people,  and  that,  in  this  its
