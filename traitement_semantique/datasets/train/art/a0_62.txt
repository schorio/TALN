WHAT  IS  ART?  19 
/  judgments  of  the  ancients  on  beauty  to  our  conception  of  it, 
as  is  usually  done  in  aesthetics,  we  give  the  words  of    the 
I   ancients  a  meaning  which  is  not  theirs.1 
1  See    on    this    matter    Benard's     admirable     book,     L'esthe'tique 
d'Aristote,  also  Walter's  Geschichte  der  Aesthetik  im  Altertum.
