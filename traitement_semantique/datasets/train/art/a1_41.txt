elements. A small, brightly colored shape
or form in one area of a work will balancea larger, dull one elsewhere. The twoshapes carry the same “visual weight.”Works of this type are said to have infor-
mal balance. Look at the painting in Fig-
ure 2–3 . What single large form is your
eye drawn to? What smaller, brighterforms command the same attention?
●Radial balance. In art with radial balance,
shapes or forms are arranged around acentral point. Snowflakes exhibit radialbalance. So do bicycle tires. For an ex-ample of radial balance in art, look againat Figure 2–2. Notice the half circles at the top of each panel. See how the gold-colored teardrop shapes in each seem toextend outward from an invisible point.

creative in your search. With pencil anda sketch pad, make sketches of at leastthree items. Share your sketches withclassmates. Challenge them to identifythe type of balance in each sketch.
