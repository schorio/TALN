WHAT  IS  ART?  77 
their  portraits  were  painted,  and  their  statues  carved,  in 
various  adulatory  ways.  Next,  the  element  of  sexual  desire 
began  more  and  more  to  enter  into  art,  and  (with  very  few 
exceptions,  and  in  novels  and  dramas  almost  without 
exception)  it  has  now  become  an  essential  feature  of  every 
art  product  of  the  rich  classes. 
The  third  feeling  transmitted  by  the  art  of  the  rich — that 
of  discontent  with  life— appeared  yet  later  in  modern  art. 
This  feeling,  which,  at  the  commencement  of  the  present 
century,  was  expressed  only  by  exceptional  men ;  by  Byron, 
by  Leopardi,  and  afterwards  by  Heine,  has  latterly  become 
fashionable  and  is  expressed  by  most  ordinary  and  empty 
people.  Most  justly  does  the  French  critic  Douinic 
characterise  the  works  of  the  new  writers — "  c'cst  la 
latitude  de  vivre,  le  mepris  de  Vepoque  presente,  le  regret 
(Tun  autre  temps  aper$u  a  tracers  ^illusion  de  J'art,  le 
f/otit  du  paradoxe,  le  besoin  de  se  singulariser,  une  aspira 
tion  de  rqffines  vers  la  simplicite,  V adoration  enfantine  du 
merveilleux,  la  seduction  maladivc  de  la  reverie ,  Tebranlement 
des  nerfs, — surtout  I'appel  exaspere  de  la  sensualite"  (Les 
Jeunes,  Keii6  Doumic).1  And,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  of  these 
three  feelings  it  is  sensuality,  the  lowest  (accessible  not 
only  to  all  men  but  even  to  all  animals)  which  forms  the 
chief  subject-matter  of  works  of  art  of  recent  times. 
From  Boccaccio  to  Marcel  Prevost,  all  the  novels,  poems, 
and  verses  invariably  transmit  the  feeling  of  sexual  love  in 
its  different  forms.  Adultery  is  not  only  the  favourite,  but 
almost  the  only  theme  of  all  the  novels.  A  performance  is 
not  a  performance  unless,  under  some  pretence,  women  appear 
1  It  is  the  weariness  of  life,  contempt  lor  the  present  epoch,  regret 
for  another  age  seen  through  the  illusion  of  art,  a  taste  for  paradox, 
a  desire  to  be  singular,  a  sentimental  aspiration  after  simplicity,  an 
infantine  adoration  of  the  marvellous,  a  sickly  tendency  towards 
reverie,  a  shattered  condition  of  nerves,  and,  above  all,  the  ex- 
aspen  ted  demand  of  sensuality.
