13–6 is part of a Hopi festival. Festivals are 
colorful events that include food, music,dancing, and other forms of entertainment.They are celebrated in every culture. The pur-pose of some festivals is to usher in a newyear. Others are meant to ensure a bountifulharvest.
No festival would be complete without
live performances. The “performer” in Fig-
ure 13–8 is a shadow puppet . This is an art
object in the shape of an animal or human attachedto a wand or stick. Shadow puppets are popu-
lar throughout much of Asia, where they arefeatured in special events known as shadow
dances. In these events, the puppets are made
to sway gracefully to and fro behind a screen
on which a bright light has been trained. Eachfigure appears to be dancing with its shadowypartner. Can you guess the type of festival to
which this art object relates?
