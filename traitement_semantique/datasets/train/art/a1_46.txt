fast-paced action as though it were happen-ing before your eyes. Through the careful useof elements such as line, shape, and color, theartist captures movement.
In this lesson, you will learn about move-
ment as a principle of art. You will also learnabout two companion principles, rhythm,and pattern. THEPRINCIPLE OF MOVEMENT
When you meet a person for the first time,
you usually notice the eyes first. Then yourgaze moves outward to take in the shape ofthe person’s face.
The same thing happens when you look
at a work of art. Your eyes focus on one part.Then they move to the next. This visual jour-ney takes place thanks to movement . This isMovement, Rhythm, 
and Pattern
