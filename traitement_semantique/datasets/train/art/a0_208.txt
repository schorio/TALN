WHAT  IS  ART?  165 
evoked  by  Christian  religious  perception ;  and  the  simplest 
feelings — such  as  a  softened  or  a  merry  mood  caused  by 
a  song  or  an  amusing  jest  intelligible  to  everyone,  or  by 
a  touching  story,  or  a  drawing,  or  a  little  doll :  both  alike 
produce  one  and  the  same  effect — the  loving  union  of  man 
with  man.  Sometimes  people  who  are  together  are,  if  not 
hostile  to  one  another,  at  least  estranged  in  mood  and 
feeling,  till  perchance  a  story,  a  performance,  a  picture,  or 
even  a  building,  but  oftenest  of  all  music,  unites  them  all 
as  by  an  electric  flash,  and,  in  place  of  their  former  isolation 
or  even  enmity,  they  are  all  conscious  of  union  and  mutual 
love.  Each  is  glad  that  another  feels  what  he  feels ;  glad 
of  the  communion  established,  not  only  between  him  ,and 
all  present,  but  also  with  all  now  living  who  will  yet  share 
the  same  impression;  and  more  than  that,  he  feels  the 
mysterious  gladness  of  a  communion  which,  reaching  beyond 
the  grave,  unites  us  with  all  men  of  the  past  who  have 
been  moved  by  the  same  feelings,  and  with  all  men  of  the 
future  who  will  yet  be  touched  by  them.  And  this  effect.  - 
is  produced  both  by  the  religious  art  which  transmits  .» 
feelings  of  love  to  God  and  one's  neighbour,  and  by  universal  { 
art  transmitting  the  very  simplest  feelings  common  to  all  ( 
men. 
The  art  of  our  time  should  be  appraised  differently  from 
former  art  chiefly  in  this,  that  the  art  of  our  time,  i.e. 
Christian  art  (basing  itself  on  a  religious  perception  which 
demands  the  jmion  of  man),  excludes  from  the  domain  of 
art  good  in  subject-matter  everything  transmitting  exclusive 
feelings,  which  do  not  unite  but  divide  men.  It  relegates 
such  work  to  the  category  of  art  bad  in  its  subject-matter, 
while,  on  the  other  hand,  it  includes  in  the  category  of  art 
good  in  subject-matter  a  section  not  formerly  admitted  to 
deserve  to  be  chosen  out  and  respected,  namely,  universal 
art  transmitting  even  the  most  trifling  and  simple  feelings 
if  only  thev  are  accessible  to  all  men  without  exception,
