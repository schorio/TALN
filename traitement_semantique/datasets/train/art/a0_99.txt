56  WHAT  IS  ART? 
the  immediate  relationship  of  each  man  to  the  Father,  the 
consequent  brotherhood  and  equality  of  all  men,  and  the 
substitution  of  humility  and  love  in  place  of  every  kind  of 
violence — but,  on  the  contrary,  having  set  up  a  heavenly 
hierarchy  similar  to  the  pagan  mythology,  and  having  intro 
duced  the  worship  of  Christ,  of  the  Virgin,  of  angels,  of 
apostles,  of  saints,  and  of  martyrs,  and  not  only  of  these 
divinities  themselves,  but  also  of  their  images,  it  made  blind 
faith  in  the  Church  and  its  ordinances  the  essential  point  of 
its  teaching. 
However  foreign  this  teaching  may  have  been  to  true 
Christianity,  however  degraded,  not  only  in  comparison 
with  true  Christianity,  but  even  with  the  life-conception  of 
Romans  such  as  Julian  and  others ;  it  was,  for  all  that, 
to  the  barbarians  who  accepted  it,  a  higher  doctrine 
than  their  former  adoration  of  gods,  heroes,  and  good 
and  bad  spirits.  And  therefore  this  teaching  was  a 
religion  to  them,  and  on  the  basis  of  that  religion  the 
art  of  the  time  was  assessed.  And  art  transmitting  pious 
adoration  of  the  Virgin,  Jesus,  the  saints  and  the  angels, 
a  blind  faith  in  and  submission  to  the  Church,  fear  of 
torments  and  hope  of  blessedness  in  a  life  beyond  the 
grave,  was  considered  good ;  all  art  opposed  to  this  was 
considered  bad. 
The  teaching  on  the  basis  of  which  this  art  arose  was  a 
perversion  of  Christ's  teaching,  but  the  art  which  sprang  up 
on  this  perverted  teaching  was  nevertheless  a  true  art, 
because  it  corresponded  to  the  religious  view  of  life  held  by 
the  people  among  whom  it  arose. 
The  artists  of  the  Middle  Ages,  vitalised  by  the  same 
source  of  feeling — religion — as  the  mass  of  the  people,  and 
transmitting,  in  architecture,  sculpture,  painting,  music, 
poetry  or  drama,  the  feelings  and  states  of  mind  they 
experienced,  were  true  artists ;  and  their  activity,  founded 
on  the  highest  conceptions  accessible  to  their  age  and
