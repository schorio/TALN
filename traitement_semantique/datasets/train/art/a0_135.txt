92  WHAT  IS  ART  ? 
Dans  le  si  blanc  clieveu  qui  trame 
Avarement  aura  noye 
Le  flanc  enfant  d'une  sirene.1 
("Pan,"  1895,  No.  1.) 
Tliis  poem  is  not  exceptional  in  its  incomprehensibility. 
I  have  read  several  poems  by  Mallarme,  and  they  also  had 
no  meaning  whatever.  I  give  a  sample  of  his  prose  in 
Appendix  I.  There  is  a  whole  volume  of  this  prose,  called 
"Divagations."  It  is  impossible  to  understand  any  of  it. 
And  that  is  evidently  what  the  author  intended. 
And  here  is  a  song  by  Maeterlinck,  another  celebrated 
author  of  to-day: — 
Quand  il  est  sorfi, 
(J'entendis  la  porte) Quand  il  est  sorti 
Elle  avait  souri  .  .  . 
Mais  quand  il  entra 
(J'entendis  la  lampe] 
Mais  quand  il  entra 
Une  autre  etait  la  .  .  . 
Et  fai  vu  la  mort, 
(J'entendis  wn  dme) 
Et  fai  vu  la  mu,"t Qui  Vattend  encore  .  .  . 
On  est  venu  dire, 
(Mon  enfant  fai  peur) 
On  est  venu  dire 
Qu'il  allait  partir  .  .  .
