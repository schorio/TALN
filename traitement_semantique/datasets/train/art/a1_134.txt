An artist’s ties to nature
uch of Deborah Butterfield’s life is tied to the outdoors. Butterfield’s 
sculptures are about natural objects, and she uses natural objects to
create them. She especially likes sculpting horses. In fact, her life-sizehorses don’t just stand outdoors in the mud—they’re often made of mud! 
Butterfield first constructed horses from mud and sticks in 1976. She has
also created horses from old auto parts, farm equipment, and bits and piecesof metal buildings. In Butterfield’s hands, even her metallic horses appear tohave been created from natural materials.
Most people recognize Butterfield’s sculptures as horses. But if you look
closely, her horses aren’t completely realistic. She uses materials to suggestanimals rather than describe them in minute detail. Butterfield leaves viewerswith a strong sense of a horse’sanatomy and even itsspecific personality. Eachpiece, like the horsesthemselves, is unique. 
Butterfield has loved
horses since her California child-hood. Today, she and her husbandlive on a ranch in Montana,where they own realhorses. To Butterfield,living in the country is anadvantage. This closenessto her subject matter isapparent in the lifelikequality of her sculpture.
