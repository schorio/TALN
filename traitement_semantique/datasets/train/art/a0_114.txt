WHAT  IS  ART?  71 
pastime  for  rich  people  of  their  time,  for  whom  alone  they 
ever  were  of  any  importance.  It  is  also  often  urged  in 
proof  of  the  assertion  that  the  people  will  some  day  under 
stand  our  art,  that  some  productions  of  so-called  "classical" 
poetry,  music,  or  painting,  which  formerly  did  not  please 
the  masses,  do — now  that  they  have  been  offered  to  them 
from  all  sides — begin  to  please  these  same  masses ;  but  this 
only  shows  that  the  crowd,  especially  the  half-spoilt  town 
crowd,  can  easily  (its  taste  having  been  perverted)  be 
accustomed  to  any  sort  of  art.  Moreover,  this  art  is  not 
produced  by  these  masses,  nor  even  chosen  by  them,  but 
is  energetically  thrust  upon  them  in  those  public  places  in 
which  art  is  accessible  to  the  people.  For  the  great  majority 
of  working  people,  our  art,  besides  being  inaccessible  on 
account  of  its  costliness,  is  strange  in  its  very  nature, 
transmitting  as  it  does  the  feelings  of  people  far  removed 
from  those  conditions  of  laborious  life  which  are  natural  to 
the  great  body  of  humanity.  That  which  is  enjoyment  to 
a  man  of  the  rich  classes,  is  incomprehensible,  as  a  pleasure, 
to  a  working  man,  and  evokes  in  him  either  no  feeling  at 
all,  or  only  a  feeling  quite  contrary  to  that  which  it  evokes 
in  an  idle  and  satiated  man.  Such  feelings  as  form  the 
chief  subjects  of  present-day  art — say,  for  instance,  honour,1 
patriotism  and  amorousness,  evoke  in  a  working  man  only 
bewilderment  and  contempt,  or  indignation.  So  that  even 
if  a  possibility  were  given  to  the  labouring  classes,  in  their 
free  time,  to  see,  to  read,  and  to  hear  all  that  forms  the 
nower  of  contemporary  art  (as  is  done  to  some  extent  in 
towns,  by  means  of  picture  galleries,  popular  concerts,  and 
libraries),  the  working  man  (to  the  extent  to  which  he  is  a 
labourer,  and  has  not  begun  to  pass  into  the  ranks  of  those 
perverted  by  idleness)  would  be  able  to  make  nothing  of  our 
fine  art,  and  if  he  did  understand  it,  that  which  he  under- 
1  Duelling  is  still  customary  among  the  higher  circles  in  Russia,  as 
in  other  Continental  countries.— Trans.
