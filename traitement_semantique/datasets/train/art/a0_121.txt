78  WHAT  IS  ART? 
with  naked  busts  and  limbs.  Songs  and  romances — all  are 
expressions  of  lust,  idealised  in  various  degrees. 
A  majority  of  the  pictures  by  French  artists  represent 
female  nakedness  in  various  forms.  In  recent  French 
literature  there  is  hardly  a  page  or  a  poem  in  which 
nakedness  is  not  described,  and  in  which,  relevantly  or 
irrelevantly,  their  favourite  thought  and  word  nu  is  not 
repeated  a  couple  of  times.  There  is  a  certain  writer,  Rene 
de  Gourmond,  who  gets  printed,  and  is  considered  talented. 
To  get  an  idea  of  the  new  writers,  I  read  his  novel,  Les 
Chevaux  de  Diomede.  It  is  a  consecutive  and  detailed 
account  of  the  sexual  connections  some  gentleman  had  with 
various  women.  Every  page  contains  lust-kindling  descrip 
tions.  It  is  the  same  in  Pierre  Louys'  book,  ^Aphrodite, which  met  with  success ;  it  is  the  same  in  a  book  I  lately 
chanced  upon — Huysmans'  Certains,  and,  with  but  few 
exceptions,  it  is  the  same  in  all  the  French  novels.  They 
are  all  the  productions  of  people  suffering  from  erotic 
mania.  And  these  people  are  evidently  convinced  that  as 
their  whole  life,  in  consequence  of  their  diseased  condition, 
is  concentrated  on  amplifying  various  sexual  abominations, 
therefore  the  life  of  all  the  world  is  similarly  concentrated. 
And  these  people,  suffering  from  erotic  mania,  are  imitated 
throughout  the  whole  artistic  world  of  Europe  and  America. 
Thus  in  consequence  of  the  lack  of  belief  and  the 
exceptional  manner  of  life  of  the  wealthy  classes,  the  art 
of  those  classes  became  impoverished  in  its  subject-matter, 
and  has  sunk  to  the  transmission  of  the  feelings  of  pride, 
discontent  with  life,  and,  above  all,  of  sexual  desire.
