While some artists today have borrowed
ideas and techniques of the past, others havemoved in new directions. One such ground-breaking direction is reflected in the paintingin Figure 5–19. This work is an example of
abstraction in art. As you read in Chapter 4,abstract means having a recognizable subject
that is shown in an unrealistic or simplifiedmanner. Abstract art straddles the fence be-tween representational—or realistic—art andnonobjective art. 
Examine the painting in Figure 5–19. You
will probably recognize the fragmented ob-jects in this brightly colored work. The mainone is a painter’s palette. Protruding from itis an assortment of brushes. Why has theartist chosen to shatter these familiar images?What do the picture’s content and title reveal
about the changes you read about in the pre-vious lesson?
WHATYOUWILLLEARN

own abstract painting. Through abstraction,you will express your goals and hopes for thefuture. Your finished work will exhibit a va-riety of brilliantly colored, angular shapes. Asin Figure 5–19, these will be joined together tomake a visually pleasing whole.
