WHAT  IS  ART?  89 
Corneille  poussive 
Et  vous,  les  loups  maigres, 
Par  ces  bises  aigres 
Quoi  done  vous  arrive  ? 
Dans  V interminable 
Ennui  de  la  plaine, 
La  neige  incertaine 
Luit  comme  du  sable.1 
How  does  the  moon  seem  to  live  and  die  in  a  copper 
heaven "?  And  how  can  snow  shine  like  sand  1  The  whole 
thing  is  not  merely  unintelligible,  but,  under  pretence  of 
conveying  an  impression,  it  passes  off  a  string  of  incorrect 
comparisons  and  words. 
Besides  these  artificial  and  obscure  poems,  there  are 
others  which  are  intelligible,  but  which  make  up  for  it  by 
being  altogether  bad,  both  in  form  and  in  subject.  Such 
arc  all  the  poems  under  the  heading  La  Sagesse.  The  chief 
place  in  these  verses  is  occupied  by  a  very  poor  expression  of 
the  most  commonplace  Roman  Catholic  and  patriotic  senti 
ments.  For  instance,  one  meets  with  verses  such  as  this  : â€” 
Je  ne  veux  plus  penser  qu'  a  ma  mere  Mane, 
Siege  de  la  sagesse  et  source  de  pardons, 
Mere  de  France  aussi  de  qui  nous  attentions 
Intibranlablement  I'honneur  de  la  patrie.'2 
Before  citing  examples  from  other  poets,  T  must  pause  to 
1  For  translation,  see  Appendix  I V. 
2  I   do  not  wish  to  think  any  more,    except  about   my  mother Mary, 
Seat  of  wisdom  and  source  of  pardon, 
Also  Mother  of  France,  from  ivliom  ice 
Steadfastly  expect  the  honour  of  our  country.
