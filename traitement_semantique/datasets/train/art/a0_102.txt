WHAT  IS  ART?  59 
enough  to  accept  true  Christianity,  men  of  these  rich, 
governing  classes — popes,  kings,  dukes,  and  all  the  great  ones 
of  the  earth — were  left  without  any  religion,  with  but  the 
external  forms  of  one,  which  they  supported  as  being 
profitable  and  even  necessary  for  themselves,  since  these 
forms  screened  a  teaching  which  justified  those  privileges 
which  they  made  use  of.  In  reality,  these  people  believed 
in  nothing,  just  as  the  Eomans  of  the  first  centuries  of  our 
era  believed  in  nothing.  But  at  the  same  time  these  were 
the  people  who  had  the  power  and  the  wealth,  and  these 
were  the  people  who  rewarded  art  and  directed  it. 
And,  let  it  be  noticed,  it  was  just  among  these  people  that 
there  grew  up  an  art  esteemed  not  according  to  its  success  in 
expressing  men's  religious  feelings,  but  in  proportion  to  its 
beauty, — in  other  words,  according  to  the  enjoyment  it 
gave. 
No  longer  able  to  believe  in  the  Church  religion  whose 
falsehood  they  had  detected,  and  incapable  of  accepting  true 
Christian  teaching,  which  denounced  their  whole  manner  of 
life,  these  rich  and  powerful  people,  stranded  without  any 
religious  conception  of  life,  involuntarily  returned  to  that 
pagan  view  of  things  which  places  life's  meaning  in  personal 
enjoyment.  And  then  took  place  among  the  upper  classes 
what  is  called  the  "Renaissance  of  science  and  art,"  and 
which  was  really  not  only  a  denial  of  every  religion  but 
also  an  assertion  that  religion  is  unnecessary. 
The  Church  doctrine  is  so  coherent  a  system  that  it  cannot 
be  altered  or  corrected  without  destroying  it  altogether.  As 
soon  as  doubt  arose  with  regard  to  the  infallibility  of  the 
pope  (and  this  doubt  was  then  in  the  minds  of  all  educated 
people),  doubt  inevitably  followed  as  to  the  truth  of  tradition. 
But  doubt  as  to  the  truth  of  tradition  is  fatal  not  only  to 
popery  and  Catholicism,  but  also  to  the  whole  Church  creed 
with  all  its  dogmas :  the  divinity  of  Christ,  the  resurrection, 
and  the  Trinity ;  and  it  destroys  the  authority  of  the
