44 Chapter 3 Art Media and TechniquesExamine the drawing of the figures in Fig-
ure 3–6. From an art standpoint, the most 
important thing about the work is not who it
shows, but what it shows. This drawing is of
the human form. Capturing the human formhas been a goal of artists through the ages.Notice the loose, scribbly quality of most ofthe lines. The artist used a technique calledgesture drawing. This means drawing lines
quickly and loosely to capture the form and ac-tions of a subject. In gesture drawing you draw
with your whole arm, not just your hand.Some gesture drawings are merely quickscribbles. Others are done with greater pre-cision and care. How would you describe thelines the artist has used in Figure 3–6? What
parts of the subjects have been recorded withthe most care?
WHATYOUWILLLEARN
You will make several quick gesture
drawings of a classmate using several dif-ferent drawing media. Focus on the form andaction of the subject, not on one part, like thefoot or face. You will not be concerned withcapturing the model’s likeness, but rather thefeeling of motion. (For more information ongesture drawing, see Technique Tip 1 onpage 281.)Gesture Drawing
