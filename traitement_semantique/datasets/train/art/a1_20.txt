It might be said that all art begins with a
line. You see lines everywhere in your dailylife. As you ride in a car along a highway, theedges of the road straight ahead of you formtwo lines that meet in the distance. The edgeof each wall of your classroom is a line. So arethe curves that make up the letter s.
To th e artist, a line is the path of a dot
through space. In this lesson, you will learn
about different kinds of lines. You will seehow these lines can be used to suggest spe-cific feelings and ideas.
KINDS OF LINE
By definition, every line goes somewhere.
Aline may “travel” up, down, or across. It
may move at an angle, or it may curve backon itself. Each type of line carries a differentmessage to the viewer.
There are five main kinds of line: hori-
zontal, vertical, diagonal, curved, and zigzag.
Horizontal
Horizontal lines run from side to side.
Lines of this type seem to be at rest. They maysuggest peace and quiet. Think of the line ofa calm lake where the water meets the sky(Figure 1–4 ).

Vertical
Vertical lines run
up and down. Theynever lean. Lines ofthis type seem to bestanding at atten-tion. Artists use ver-tical lines to showstrength a nd per-
manence. Picture thesoaring lines of askyscraper ( Figure
1–5).
Diagonal
Diagonal lines are
straight lines thatslant. Lines of thistype suggest a senseof movement and ex-citement. They seemto be rising or falling.Diagonal lines areused to give a senseof movement.
Curved
Curved lines are
lines that change direction little by little. Wiggly lines are made up of twoor more curves. Spi-rals and circles alsobegin with curvedlines. Like diagonals,curved lines expressmovement, but in amore graceful way(Figure 1–6 ).
