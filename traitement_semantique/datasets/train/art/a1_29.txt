So is the outline of your hand. The art-work in Figure 1–3 on page 5 is made upof a number of free-form shapes. Howmany different shapes can you find?
FORM
Like shapes, forms have height and
width. Unlike shapes, they also have a thirddimension: depth. Form is an element of art
that refers to an object with three dimensions.When you hold a book in your hand, you areexperiencing its form in three dimensions:height, width, and depth. 
Forms are grouped as geometric or free-
form, much as shapes are. An aluminum can is an example of the geometric formcalled cylinder. Rocks and clouds, by contrast,
are free-form.
In art, a close relationship exists between
shapes and forms. A two-dimensional circleand three-dimensional sphere have the sameround outline. A two-dimensional square 
can be “stretched” into a third dimension tobecome a cube. These and other shape/formrelations are shown in Figure 1–15.
SPACE
All objects take up space. Space is the dis-
tance or area between, around, above, below, andwithin things. Space is empty until shapes or
forms fill it. 
In some works of art, space is real. In 
others, it is only suggested. Compare the artworks in Figures 1–16 and 1–17 on pages
16–17. The first is an example of sculpture. Itexists in three dimensions. If you were view-ing this work in person, you could walkaround it. You could enter its space and ap-preciate its form.
The second work of art is a painting. The
scene looks very realistic and lifelike. If youtried to move forward into it, however, youwould bump into a flat surface.
