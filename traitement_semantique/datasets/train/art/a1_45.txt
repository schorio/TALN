figures. What object or element is empha-
sized in the work in Figure 2–6?
THEPRINCIPLE OF PROPORTION
As an art principle, proportion is how
parts of a work relate to each other and to thewhole. Alarge shape in a picture filled with
smaller shapes would stand out because ofthe different proportions in size. Look oncemore at the sculpture in Figure 2–7. Noticehow the larger-than-life size of the figuresadds to their importance and interest.
