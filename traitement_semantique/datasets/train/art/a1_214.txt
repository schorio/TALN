Captivating objects of color and shape
hen is glass not just glass? When it was fashioned
by Louis Comfort Tiffany. Tiffany was a decorator,
craftsperson, and glassmaker who designedextraordinary items for the home. His glasslampshades and stained-glass windowswere beautiful and functional.
Born in 1848, Louis Comfort Tiffany
trained as a painter until hediscovered the art of glass.His technical advances to theart of making glass objectswere as important as hissuperb design work.
For centuries,
glassmakers hadplaced pieces ofglass within leadframes. Tiffany changed that byincorporating metal strips directly into his designs.Tiffany also invented his own glass in many colors. It 
is Tiffany’s intense palette and finishes that make hislamps and vases so special. By 1900, Tiffany said thathe could use 5,000 mixes of colors to reproduce “vast[and] teeming…nature.” Nature’s images and its colorsinspired countless Tiffany masterpieces that shimmer,glow, and play with light.
