xxxvi  AUTHORS  PREFACE. 
my  name  containing  thoughts  attributed  to  me  which  are 
not  mine. 
I  was  persuaded  to  give  my  article  to  a  Eussian  magazine, 
in  order  that  my  thoughts,  which  may  he  useful,  should 
become  the  possession  of  Eussian  readers;  and  the  result 
has  been  that  my  name  is  affixed  to  a  work  from  which 
it  might  be  assumed  that  I  quite  arbitrarily  assert  things 
contrary  to  the  general  opinion,  without  adducing  my 
reasons ;  that  I  only  consider  false  patriotism  bad,  but  patriot 
ism  in  general  a  very  good  feeling ;  that  I  merely  deny  the 
absurdities  of  the  Eoman  Catholic  Church  and  disbelieve 
in  the  Madonna,  but  that  I  believe  in  the  Orthodox  Eastern 
faith  and  in  the  "  Mother  of  God  " ;  that  I  consider  all  the 
writings  collected  in  the  Bible  to  be  holy  books,  and  see 
the  chief  importance  of  Christ's  life  in  the  Eedemption  of 
mankind  by  his  death. 
I  have  narrated  all  this  in  such  detail  because  it  strik 
ingly  illustrates  the  indubitable  truth,  that  all  compromise 
with  institutions  of  which  your  conscience  disapproves, — 
compromises  which  are  usually  made  for  the  sake  of  the 
general  good, — instead  of  producing  the  good  you  expected, 
inevitably  lead  you  not  only  to  acknowledge  the  institution 
you  disapprove  of,  but  also  to  participate  in  the  evil  that 
institution  produces. 
I  am  glad  to  be  able  by  this  statement  at  least  to  do 
something  to  correct  the  error  into  which  I  was  led  by 
my  compromise. 
I  have  also  to  mention  that  besides  reinstating  the  parts 
excluded  by  the  Censor  from  the  Eussian  editions,  other 
corrections  and  additions  of  importance  have  been  made  in 
this  edition.
