How the artist answers the question about
negative space will affect the viewer’s re-action to the work. Look back at the artworkin Figure 1–3 on page 5. There is far morenegative space than form to this work. Theabundance of negative space gives it a light,airy feel. Contrast this with the negativespace in Figure 1–16. This sculpture seemsheavier and more compact because there isless negative space.
Little negative space in a painting or
drawing makes the work look busy. A lot ofnegative space can express calm, peace, oreven loneliness.
Lesson 5 Shape, Form, and Space 17Sketching a Still Life
Illustrate themes from direct obser-
vation.Look back at the painting of
apples in Figure 1–2 on page 4. Thiswork is an example of a type of art
called still life. A still life is a painting or
drawing of nonmoving objects. What
nonmoving objects besides fruit did theartist choose for this still life? Whattechniques did he use to achieve asense of space?
Plan a still life of your own by gather-
ing several familiar objects. Illustrate atheme from direct observation usingbooks, pencils, and other materialsfound in the classroom. Arrange these
on a table. Study the arrangement fromdifferent angles. Make pencil sketchesfrom several different views. Be sure touse techniques such as overlapping tocapture a feeling of space.
