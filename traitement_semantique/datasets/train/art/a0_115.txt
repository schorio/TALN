72  WHAT  IS  ART? 
stood  would  not  elevate  his  soul,  but  would  certainly,  in 
most  cases,  pervert  it.     To  thoughtful  and  sincere  people 
I  there  can  therefore  be  no  doubt  that  the  art  of  our  upper 
classes  never  can  be  the  art  of  the  whole  people.  But  if  art 
is  an  important  matter,  a  spiritual  blessing,  essential  for 
\all  men  ("like  religion,"  as  the  devotees  of  art  are  fond  of 
paying),  then  it  should  be  accessible  to  everyone.  And  if,  as 
p  our  day,  it  is  not  accessible  to  all  men,  then  one  of  two 
things  :  either  art  is  not  the  vital  matter  it  is  represented 
to  be,  or  that  art  which  we  call  art  is  not  the  real  thing. 
The  dilemma  is  inevitable,  and  therefore  clever  and 
immoral  people  avoid  it  by  denying  one  side  of  it,  viz. 
denying  that  the  common  people  have  a  right  to  art.  These 
people  simply  and  boldly  speak  out  (what  lies  at  the  heart 
of  the  matter),  and  say  that  the  participators  in  and  utilisers 
of  what  in  their  esteem  is  highly  beautiful  art,  i.e.  art 
furnishing  the  greatest  enjoyment,  can  only  be  "schone 
Geister,"  "the  elect,"  as  the  romanticists  called  them,  the 
"  Uebermenschen,"  as  they  are  called  by  the  followers  of 
Nietzsche ;  the  remaining  vulgar  herd,  incapable  of  ex 
periencing  these  pleasures,  must  serve  the  exalted  pleasures 
of  this  superior  breed  of  people.  The  people  who  express 
these  views  at  least  do  not  pretend  and  do  not  try  to  com 
bine  the  incombinable,  but  frankly  admit,  what  is  the  case, 
that  our  art  is  an  art  of  the  upper  classes  only.  So, 
essentially,  art  has  been,  and  is,  understood  by  everyone 
engaged  on  it  in  our  society.
