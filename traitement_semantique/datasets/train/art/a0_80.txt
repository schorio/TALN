WHAT  IS  ART?  37 
Sully  in  his  Sensation  and  Intuition :  Studies  in  Psychology 
and  ^Esthetics  (1874),  dismisses  the  conception  of  beauty 
altogether,  art,  by  his  definition,  being  the  production  of 
some  permanent  object  or  passing  action  fitted  to  supply 
active  enjoyment  to  the  producer,  and  a  pleasurable  im 
pression  to  a  number  of  spectators  or  listeners,  quite  apart 
from  any  personal  advantage  derived  from  it.1
