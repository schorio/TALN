WHAT  IS  ART?  55 
And  therefore,  among  all  nations,  art  which  transmitted 
feelings  considered  to  be  good  by  this  general  religious 
sense  was  recognised  as  being  good  and  was  encouraged ; 
but  art  which  transmitted  feelings  considered  to  be  bad  by 
this  general  religious  conception,  was  recognised  as  being 
bad,  and  was  rejected.  All  the  rest  of  the  immense  field 
of  art  by  means  of  which  people  communicate  one  with 
another,  was  not  esteemed  at  all,  and  was  only  noticed  when 
it  ran  counter  to  the  religious  conception  of  its  age,  and 
then  merely  to  be  repudiated.  Thus  it  was  among  all 
nations, — Greeks,  Jews,  Indians,  Egyptians,  and  Chinese, 
— and  so  it  was  when  Christianity  appeared. 
The  Christianity  of  the  first  centuries  recognised  as 
productions  of  good  art,  only  legends,  lives  of  saints, 
sermons,  prayers  and  hymn-singing,  evoking  love  of  Christ, 
emotion  at  his  life,  desire  to  follow  his  example,  renuncia 
tion  of  worldly  life,  humility,  and  the  love  of  others ;  all 
productions  transmitting  feelings  of  personal  enjoyment 
they  considered  to  be  bad,  and  therefore  rejected :  for 
instance,  tolerating  plastic  representations  only  when  they 
were  symbolical,  they  rejected  all  the  pagan  sculptures. 
This  was  so  among  the  Christians  of  the  first  centuries, 
who  accepted  Christ's  teaching,  if  not  quite  in  its  true  form, 
at  least  not  in  the  perverted,  paganised  form  in  which  it 
was  accepted  subsequently. 
But  besides  this  Christianity,  from  the  time  of  the  whole 
sale  conversion  of  nations  by  order  of  the  authorities,  as  in 
the  days  of  Constantino,  Charlemagne,  and  Vladimir,  there 
appeared  another,  a  Church  Christianity,  which  was  nearer 
to  paganism  than  to  Christ's  teaching.  And  this  Church 
Christianity,  in  accordance  with  its  own  teaching,  estimated 
quite  otherwise  the  feelings  of  people  and  the  productions 
of  art  which  transmitted  those  feelings. 
This  Church  Christianity  not  only  did  not  acknowledge  the 
fundamental  and  essential  positions  of  true  Christianity, —
