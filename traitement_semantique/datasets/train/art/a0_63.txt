CHAPTER   III 
I  BEGIN  with  the  founder  of  aesthetics,  Baumgarten  (1714— 
1762). 
According  to  Baumgarten,1  the  object  of  logical  knowledge 
is  Truth,  the  object  of  aesthetic  (i.e.  sensuous)  knowledge 
is  Beauty.  Beauty  is  the  Perfect  (the  Absolute),  recog 
nised  through  the  senses  ;  Truth  is  -the  Perfect  perceived 
through  reason ;  Goodness  is  the  Perfect  reached  by  moral 
will. 
Beauty  is  denned  by  Baumgarten  as  a  correspondence,  i.e. 
an  order  of  the  parts  in  their  mutual  relations  to  each 
other  and  in  their  relation  to  the  whole.  The  aim  of  beauty 
itself  is  to  please  and  excite  a  desire,  "  Wohlgef alien  und 
Erregung  eines  Verlangens."  (A  position  precisely  the  opposite 
of  Kant's  definition  of  the  nature  and  sign  of  beauty.) 
With  reference  to  the  manifestations  of  beauty,  Baum 
garten  considers  that  the  highest  embodiment  of  beauty 
is  seen  by  us  in  nature,  and  he  therefore  thinks  that  the 
highest  aim  of  art  is  to  copy  nature.  (This  position 
also  is  directly  contradicted  by  the  conclusions  of  the 
latest  aestheticians.) 
Passing  over  the  unimportant  followers  of  Baumgarten, — 
Maier,  Eschenburg,  and  Eberhard, — who  only  slightly 
modified  the  doctrine  of  their  teacher  by  dividing  the 
pleasant  from  the  beautiful,  I  will  quote  the  definitions 
given  by  writers  who  came  immediately  after  Baumgarten, 
and  defined  beauty  quite  in  another  way.  These  writers
