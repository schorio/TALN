In “Cow Parade, ” some cows look like 
art, and others look like . . . cows!
tudents at Poe School in Houston,
Texas, didn’t have a beef sharing
their classroom with a cow. In fact,they loved it! The cow in this casewas made of fiberglass. The studentsdecorated the donated critter with 700 hearts and named it Cupid.“The whole school worked on it,”says Harry Perkins, a student at Poe.
Unlike the classroom cow, most of
the 300 cow sculptures for Houston’s“Cow Parade” were created by profes-sional artists. The cows were later soldat auction, raising more than one million dollars for charity. Today, each individually designed cow livesin Houston. Some are in private homes, some gracecity parks, and others milk the attentionof passersby outside office buildings.
The “Cow Parade” idea started with
Swiss-born artist Pascal Knapp. He firstsculpted a cow for a public art event inSwitzerland in 1998. Since then, severalcities have held “Cow Parades,”including New York, Kansas City,Portland, and Sydney, Australia.
