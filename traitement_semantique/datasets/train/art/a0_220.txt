WHAT  IS  ART?  177 
play  scales  and  exorcises ;  others  should  twist  their  limbs, 
walk  on  their  toes,  and  lift  their  legs  above  their  heads ; 
a  third  set  should  sing  solfeggios  ;  a  fourth  set,  showing 
themselves  off  in  all  manner  of  ways,  should  pronounce 
verses ;  a  fifth  set  should  draw  from  busts  or  from  nude 
models  and  paint  studies ;  a  sixth  set  should  write  compo 
sitions  according  to  the  rules  of  certain  periods ;  and  that 
in  these  occupations,  unworthy  of  a  human  being,  which  are 
often  continued  long  after  full  maturity,  they  should  waste 
their  physical  and  mental  strength  and  lose  all  perception 
of  the  meaning  of  life.  It  is  often  said  that  it  is  horrible 
and  pitiful  to  see  little  acrobats  putting  their  legs  over 
their  necks,  but  it  is  not  less  pitiful  to  see  children  of  10 
giving  concerts,  and  it  is  still  worse  to  see  schoolboys  of 
10  who,  as  a  preparation  for  literary  work,  have  learnt  by 
heart  the  exceptions  to  the  Latin  grammar.  These  people  not 
only  grow  physically  and  mentally  deformed,  but  also  morally 
deformed,  and  become  incapable  of  doing  anything  really 
needed  by  man.  Occupying  in  society  the  role  of  amusers  of 
the  rich,  they  lose  their  sense  of  human  dignity,  and  develop 
in  themselves  such  a  passion  for  public  applause  that  they 
are  ahvays  a  prey  to  an  inflated  and  unsatisfied  vanity 
which  grows  in  them  to  diseased  dimensions,  and  they  ex 
pend  their  mental  strength  in  efforts  to  obtain  satisfaction 
for  this  passion.  And  what  is  most  tragic  of  all  is  that 
these  people,  who  for  the  sake  of  art  are  spoilt  for  life, 
not  only  do  not  render  service  to  this  art,  but,  on  the 
contrary,  inflict  the  greatest  harm  on  it.  They  are  taught 
in  academies,  schools,  and  conservatoires  how  to  counterfeit 
art,  and  by  learning  this  they  so  pervert  themselves  that 
they  quite  lose  the  capacity  to  produce  works  of  real  art, 
and  become  purveyors  of  that  counterfeit,  or  trivial,  or 
depraved  art  which  floods  our  society.  This  is  the  first 
obvious  consequence  of  the  perversion  of  the  organ  of art.
