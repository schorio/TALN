and  the  symbolists ;  the  symbolists  disown  all  their  pre 
decessors  and  les  mages  ;  and  Ics  mages  disown  all,  all  their 
predecessors.  Among  novelists  we  have  naturalists,  psycho 
logists,  and  " nature-is ts,:'  all  rejecting  each  other.  Audit 
is  the  same  in  dramatic  art,  in  painting  and  in  music.  So 
that  art,  which  demands  such  tremendous  labour-sacrifices 
from  the  people,  which  stunts  human  lives  and  transgresses 
against  human  love,  is  not  only  not  a  thing  clearly  and 
firmly  denned,  but  is  understood  in  sucli  contradictory  ways 
by  its  own  devotees  that  it  is  difficult  to  say  what  is  meant 
by  art,  and  especially  what  is  good,  useful  art, â€” art  for  the 
sake  of  which  we  might  condone  such  sacrifices  as  are  being 
offered  at  its  shrine.
