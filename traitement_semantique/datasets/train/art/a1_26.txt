12 Chapter 1 The Elements of ArtArtists look at the world around them and
see far more than a blue sky and green grass.Claude Monet was called an Impressionist
painter because he looked at the landscape atdifferent times of day and saw every color ofthe rainbow. At dawn he found purples,pinks, and blues in the farmer’s wheat stacks.At noon these stacks appeared to be blazingoranges and yellows. He painted “impres-sions” of the wheat stack in Figure 1–12 by
laying strokes of many colors on his canvas.WHATYOUWILLLEARN
You will demonstrate technical skills by
mixing tempera paints to discover colors. Youwill use two primary colors and white. Each
time you add a stroke of one of these colorsand blend it on your paper, you can make a new color. When you have filled yourpaper, you will have a rich painting. Try tomix as many variations of your two colors aspossible.Mixing Colors
