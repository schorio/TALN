ART OF ANCIENT JAPAN
The civilization of the Indus River valley
is among the earliest on record. Evidence ofan even older culture has been found on theisland nation of Japan. This culture is be-lieved to have sprung to life around 5000 
B.C.
As with Indian art, the art of ancient Japan
was inspired by religion. Interestingly, one ofthe religions that shaped much of earlyJapanese art began in India and then came toJapan through China in 
A.D.552. That religion
is Buddhism ( boo-diz-uhm). Buddhism was
an outgrowth of Hinduism. It emphasizesphysical and spiritual discipline as the meansfor reaching a state of inner peace.
Screen Painting
One common form of Japanese artistic ex-
pression is shown in Figure 5–8. Each object
is a painted screen. This is an art object used 
as a wall or room divider. Do you recall the 
name for art that is both useful and pleasingto the eye?
Look carefully at these screens. They
show two creatures, one real and one mythi-cal. Both have symbolic value. The tiger wasbelieved to chase evil. The dragon wasthought to bring luck.
