.   WHAT  IS  ART?  161 
It  is  true  that  art  which  satisfies  the  demands  of  the 
religious  perception  of  our  time  is  quite  unlike  former 
art,  hut,  notwithstanding  this  dissimilarity,  to  a  man 
who  does  not  intentionally  hide  the  truth  from  himself, 
it  is  very  clear  and  definite  what  does  form  the  religious 
art  of  our  age.  In  former  times,  when  the  highest 
religious  perception  united  only  some  people  (who,  even 
if  they  formed  a  large  society,  were  yet  but  one 
society  surrounded  by  others — Jews,  or  Athenian  or  Roman 
citizens),  the  feelings  transmitted  by  the  art  of  that  time 
flowed  from  a  desire  for  the  might,  greatness,  glory,  and 
prosperity  of  that  society,  and  the  heroes  of  art  might  be 
people  who  contributed  to  that  prosperity  by  strength,  by 
craft,  by  fraud,  or  by  cruelty  (Ulysses,  Jacob,  David,  Samson, 
Hercules,  and  all  the  heroes).  But  the  religious  perception 
of  our  times  does  not  select  any  one  society  of  men ;  on 
the  contrary,  it  demands  the  union  of  all — absolutely  of  all 
people  without  exception — and  above  every  other  virtue  it 
sets  brotherly  love  to  all  men.  And,  therefore,  the  feelings 
transmitted  by  the  art  of  our  time  not  only  cannot  coincide 
with  the  feelings  transmitted  by  iormer  art,  but  must  run 
counter  to  them. 
Christian,  truly  Christian,  art  has  been  so  long  in  establish 
ing  itself,  and  has  not  yet  established  itself,  just  because  the 
Christian  religious  perception  was  not  one  of  those  small 
steps  by  which  humanity  advances  regularly,  but  was  an 
enormous  revolution,  which,  if  it  has  not  already  altered, 
must  inevitably  alter  the  entire  life-conception  of  mankind, 
and,  consequently,  the  whole  internal  organisation  of  their 
life.  It  is  true  that  the  life  of  humanity,  like  that  of  an 
individual,  moves  regularly ;  but  in  that  regular  movement 
come,  as  it  were,  turning-points,  which  sharply  divide  the 
preceding  from  the  subsequent  life.  Christianity  was  such 
a  turning-point;  such,  at  least,  it  must  appear  to  us  who 
live  by  the  Christian  perception  of  life.  Christian  perception 1 1
