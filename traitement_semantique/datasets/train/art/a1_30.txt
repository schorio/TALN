Space Techniques in 
Two-Dimensional Art
The artist who painted the street scene in
Figure 1–17 used several techniques to cap-ture the feeling of deep space. Artists havedeveloped a number of such techniques.These include the following:
●Linear perspective. The lines of
buildings, roads, and similar objects areslanted. This makes them appear to cometogether or meet in the distance.
●Size. Distant objects are made smaller
than objects that are close up.
●Overlapping. Nearer shapes and forms
overlap, or partly cover, those meant toappear farther away.
●Placement. Distant objects are placed
higher up in the picture. Closer ones areplaced lower down.●Intensity and value. The colors of objects
meant to appear in the distance are lowerin intensity than objects meant to appearnearer. They are also lighter in value.
●Detail. More detail is added to closer
objects and less detail is added to those in the distance.
Which of these techniques was used in
Figure 1–17? What other steps has the artisttaken to make forms seem to stand out inspace? 
Negative Space
When it comes to the element of space,
there is one question every artist must an-swer. That is the question of how much neg-ative space to build into a work. Negative
space is the empty spaces between the shapes or
forms in two- and three-dimensional art.

used real or suggested space?
