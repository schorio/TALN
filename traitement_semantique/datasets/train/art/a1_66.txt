THEMEDIA OF SCULPTURE
Like other artists, sculptors use a wide va-
riety of media in their work. One sculptingmedium is marble. Various woods and met-als are other sculpting media. What mediumwas used for the sculpture in Figure 3–14?
No matter what medium is used, a work
of sculpture will be one of two types:
●Sculpture in the round. This is a type of
sculpture that is surrounded on all sides
by space. Another name for sculpture inthe round is freestanding sculpture. Like
Figure 3–14, sculptures in the round canbe statues of people. Not all freestandingsculptures have recognizable subjects,however. Examine the sculpture in Fig-ure 1–16 on page 16.
●Relief sculpture. This is a type of sculp-
ture in which forms extend into space on one side only. Figure 3–15 shows an
example of relief sculpture. If you couldwalk around to the back of this sculpture,you would find that it is flat.
SCULPTING PROCESSES
There are four basic sculpting processes.
Each gives a different result. These are:
●Carving. In this process, the sculptor
starts with a block of material. He or shecuts or chips away pieces of the block.The relief sculpture in Figure 3–15 wascreated by carving. What medium did thesculptor use?
