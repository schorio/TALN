216 Chapter 11 Recording EventsTechnology and art have always been
partners. The invention of paint in tubes inthe mid-1800s freed artists for the first timeto go outdoors and paint. Advances of thepast hundred years have had equal impor-tance and impact. In this lesson you will lookat some of these advances and their effect onthe field of visual reporting.
MOTION PICTURES
The visual records of generations past, as
you have seen, were created using a varietyof media. Yet, all shared a common limitation.All, even the camera, provided “frozen”views of an action event. If a still image isworth a thousand words, how many wordscould be expressed by a moving visual record?
An answer to this question came shortly
before the beginning of the twentieth century.It was delivered in the form of the techno-
logical breakthrough pictured in Figure
11–14 . This item, the kinetoscope (kuh- net-uh-
skohp), was a forerunner of the modernmovie projector. It was invented by the sameperson who gave us the electric lightbulb. Hisname was Thomas Edison. Examine this de-vice. Do any of the parts look familiar? Canyou guess what any of them do?
THEVIDEOREVOLUTION
The kinetoscope produced moving images
by rapidly stringing together still ones. Thissame principle is at work in today’s movieand video cameras. In the last few years,video cameras have advanced to digital videocameras. Digital video cameras increase cre-ativity by expanding ways to quickly and eas-ily edit and rearrange images, sound, and text.
