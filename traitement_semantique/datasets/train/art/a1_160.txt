Have you ever heard the expression
“whistling in the dark?” It refers to efforts tolook and sound brave in the face of danger.The iron mask in Figure 8–4 was created for
much the same purpose. It was worn by a fifteenth-century Japanese warrior—makinghim look fierce and frightening to enemies,while adding to his own confidence in battle.Take a closer look at this art object. Notice the
furrowed brow, the wide-open eyes, and theangry scowl. Does the expression on thismask succeed in frightening you?WHATYOUWILLLEARN
