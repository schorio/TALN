How many products have you seen that
carry the words all natural on their labels?
This phrase has become commonplace intoday’s society. It represents peoples’ desireto live in a healthy way and to appreciate nature. Artists have valued and representednature throughout the years. Their workshave long paid tribute to nature’s beauty andits bounty.
LANDSCAPES
What do you see when you look out the
nearest window? Do you see buildings, street-lights, and cars? Maybe you see plants, trees,and hills. If your answer leans more towardthe second description, you are looking at alandscape. In art, the word landscape refers to
a drawing or painting of mountains, trees, or othernatural scenery. Artists have been creating land-
scapes for more than one thousand years.The possible subjects for a landscape are
limitless. So are the ways in which artistshave chosen to represent nature scenes. Thelandscapes in Figures 6–2 and 6–3show two
examples that have some similarities andsome differences.
Perspective in a Landscape
Examine the painting in Figure 6–2. It
shows a hilly Pennsylvania town in the early1900s. What do you see first when you lookat this painting? Is your eye attracted to thelarge building on the hill? What do you noticenext? The train, the river, or the little build-ings in the foreground? Notice that the artisthas made these buildings smaller than thosein the distance. Why might the artist have cre-ated this visual puzzle? Perhaps he wantedto give more importance to the flag blowingproudly in the wind.
