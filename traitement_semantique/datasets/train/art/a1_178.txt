164 Chapter 9 Visiting PlacesRooms come in all sizes and shapes. Some
are large and airy. Others are small andcramped. How would you describe yourroom at home? Regardless of your answer to
that question, this much is clear: your room,whether or not it is shared, is one of a kind. Itcontains your personal things, and there is noother place exactly like it.
Perhaps it is this unique quality that has
made rooms a popular subject for art.
PAINTING OF A ROOM
Possibly the first artist ever to make a pic-
ture of his room was Vincent van Gogh (vangoh). You may have heard of him. Books,
movies, and even a song have been devotedto his dark, troubled life. Before van Gogh,few artists thought a room without peoplecould be a subject worthy of art. Yet, the artistfound peace and safety in his simple room
that he could find nowhere else. He wantedto express his personal feelings in his art.
Look closely at van Gogh’s painting of his
room in Figure 9–2. What do you think he
was trying to say about this safe haven in astormy world? What objects did he empha-size? Did you notice that the window shut-ters are closed? What meaning, if any, do youattach to this? Carefully study each of theitems in the room. Do these items tell youanything about the artist’s feelings or mood?
