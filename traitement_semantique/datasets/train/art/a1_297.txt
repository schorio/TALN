used to focus on one area of ascene, you can better zero in onan object you plan to draw byusing a viewing frame (FigureT–4). To make a viewing frame,do the following:1.Cut a rectangular hole in a
piece of paper about 2 inchesin from the paper’s edges.
2.Hold the paper at arm’s
length and look through thehole at your subject. Imaginethat the hole represents yourdrawing paper.
3.Decide how much of the
subject you want to have inyour drawing.
4.By moving the frame up,
down, sideways, nearer orfarther, you can change thefocus of your drawing.

There are times when you needto draw a crisp, straight line. Byusing the following techniques,you will be able to do so.1.Hold the ruler with one hand
and the pencil with the other. 
2.Place the ruler where you
wish to draw a straight line.
3.Hold the ruler with your
thumb and first two fingers.Be careful that your fingersdo not stick out beyond theedge of the ruler.
4.Press heavily on the ruler so
it will not slide while you’redrawing.
5.Hold the pencil lightly
