Lesson 2 Art & Reading 167
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
5T o where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that, the passing there
10 Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day!Yet knowing how way leads to way,
15 I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
20 And that has made all the difference.“The Road Not Taken”
