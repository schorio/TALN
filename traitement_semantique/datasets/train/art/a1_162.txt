One of the hardest parts of a barber’s or
hairstylist’s job is working on a customerwho won’t sit still. Even the slightest move-ment presents a real challenge to the stylist’ssure hand. 
This observation holds true not only for
haircutters but also for artists. For the artist,however, the challenge provided by thehuman body in motion is a welcome one. It is
an opportunity to present people as theyoften appear—in the midst of one activity or another.
In this lesson, you will learn about art-
works that show figures in action.FIGURE STUDIES
As emphasized in Chapter 6, the Renais-
sance artist Leonardo da Vinci filled manysketchbooks with drawings. Among thesketches he made were hundreds of figurestudies. A figure study is a drawing that fo-
cuses on the human form. Leonardo observed
and faithfully recorded in great detail theworkings of the arms and legs in motion. 
The studies Leonardo made set the stage
for generations of artists to follow. Take a moment to study the drawing in Figure 8–6 .
Notice the way in which Daumier capturesthe movement of a running messenger.
