WHAT  IS  ART?  115 
having  assimilated  them,  may  produce  such  works  a  froid, 
cold  drawn,  without  any  feeling. 
In  order  to  write  poems  a  man  of  literary  talent  needs 
only  these  qualifications  :  to  acquire  the  knack,  conformably 
with  the  requirements  of  rhyme  and  rhythm,  of  using,  in 
stead  of  the  one  really  suitable  word,  ten  others  meaning 
approximately  the  same;  to  learn  how  to  take  any  phrase 
which,  to  be  clear,  has  but  one  natural  order  of  .words,  and 
despite  all  possible  dislocations  still  to  retain  some  sense 
in  it;  and  lastly,  to  be  able,  guided  by  the  words  required 
for  the  rhymes,  to  devise  some  semblance  of  thoughts, 
feelings,  or  descriptions  to  suit  these  words.  Having 
acquired  these  qualifications,  he  may  unceasingly  produce 
poems — short  or  long,  religious,  amatory  or  patriotic,  accord 
ing  to  the  demand. 
If  a  man  of  literary  talent  wishes  to  write  a  story  or 
novel,  he  need  only  form  his  style — i.e.  learn  how  to 
describe  all  that  he  sees — and  accustom  himself  to  re

naturalistic,  social,  erotic,  psychological,  or  even  religious, 
for  which  latter  kind  a  demand  and  fashion  begins  to  show 
itself.  He  can  take  subjects  from  books  or  from  the  events 
of  life,  and  can  copy  the  characters  of  the  people  in  his  book 
from  his  acquaintances. 
And  such  novels  and  stories,  if  only  they  are  decked  out 
with  well  observed  and  carefully  rioted  details,  preferably 
erotic  ones,  will  be  considered  works  of  art,  even  though 
they  may  not  contain  a  spark  of  feeling  experienced. 
To  produce  art  in  dramatic  form,  a  talented  man,  in 
addition  to  all  that  is  required  for  novels  and  stories,  must 
also  learn  to  furnish  his  characters  with  as  many  smart 
and  witty  sentences  as  possible,  must  know  how  to  utilise 
theatrical  effects,  and  how  to  entwine  the  action  of  his
