23. Making a Mat
You can add appeal to an art
work by making a mat, usingthe following steps:1.Gather the materials you will
need. These include a metalrule, a pencil, mat board,
cardboard backing, a sheet ofheavy cardboard to protectyour work surface, a matknife with a sharp blade, andwide masking tape.
2.Wash you hands. Mat board
should be kept very clean.
3.Measure the height and
width of the work to be mat-ted. Decide how large a bor-der you want for your work.(A border of approximately2
1⁄2inches on three sides with
3 inches on the bottom is aes-theically pleasing.) Yourwork will be behind the win-dow you will cut.
4.Plan for the opening, or win-
dow, to be 
1⁄4inch smaller on
all sides than the size of yourwork. For example, if yourwork measures 9 by 12inches, the mat windowshould measure 8
1⁄2inches (9
inches minus 1⁄4inch times
two) by 111⁄2inches (12 inches
minus 1⁄4inch times two).
Using your metal rule andpencil, lightly draw yourwindow rectangle on the
back of the board 2
1⁄2inches
from the top and left edge ofthe mat. (See Figure T–23.)Add a 2
1⁄2inch border to the
right of the window and a3inch border to the bottom,
lightly drawing cuttingguidelines.
Note: If you are working
with metric measurements,the window should overlapyour work by 0.5 cm (centi-meters) on all sides. Therefore,if your work measures 24 by30 cm, the mat window mea-sures 23 cm (24 – [2 x 0.5]) by29 cm (30 – [ 2 x 0.5]).5.Place the sheet of heavy, pro-
tective cardboard on yourwork surface. Place the matboard, pencil marks up, overthe cardboard. Holding themetal rule firmly in place,score the first line with yourknife. Always place the metalrule so that your blade is
away from the frame. (SeeFigure T–24.) In case youmake an error, you will cutinto the window hole or theextra mat that is not used forthe frame. Do not try to cutthrough the board with onestroke. By the third or fourthstroke, you should be able tocut through the board easily.
6.Working in the same fashion,
score and cut through theboard along all the windowlines. Be careful not to gobeyond the lines. Remove thewindow.
7.Cut a cardboard backing for
your art work that is slightlysmaller than the overall sizeof your mat. Using a piece ofbroad masking tape, hingethe back of the mat to thebacking. (See Figure T–25.)
