can’t mix apples and oranges”? Artists havebeen ignoring this piece of advice for wellover 2,000 years. Their works have mixed apples, oranges, and countless other fruitsand objects.

OBJECTS IN STILLLIFES
An important scholar once noted that
there are no new ideas, just new combinationsof old ones. This statement certainly applies
to the works of art called still lifes. These arepaintings or drawings of inanimate, or non-moving, objects. 
The objects depicted in still lifes are famil-
iar. What is unfamiliar is their combination—their arrangement. Each still life presents itssubject matter in a new, startling way. 
A Western Still Life
As a Western art form, the still life is one
of the oldest. Descriptions of realistic paint-ings of grouped objects appear in Greek writ-ings dating back to about 2400 
B.C.
