Some painters made gritty city life their subject.
hen a critic labeled a group of
artists the “Ashcan School,” he
was talking about the gritty, urbanimages these artists painted. AshcanSchool paintings departed from thoseof the previous period. In the latenineteenth century, painters hadportrayed peaceful and calm land-scapes of the American countryside.
In the early twentieth century,
urban centers like New York Citybecame the new American “frontier.”European immigration, industrializa-tion, and migration from farms tocities began to change how—andwhere—Americans lived. 
It was this “new” America that
John Sloan (1871–1951) and otherAshcan artists depicted. Sloanpainted “ordinary” people and theirdaily lives enjoying the dance hallsand parks of New York City. Sloan’sthick, quick brushstrokes reflect thefast-paced lives that city dwellers led.Although Sloan painted people, hewas less fascinated by them than thebusy, noisy city in which they lived.
