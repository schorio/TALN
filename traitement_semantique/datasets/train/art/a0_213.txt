I/O  WHAT  IS  ART? 
with  a  particular  harmony,  it  ceases  to  be  accessible  except 
to  people  trained  to  such  harmony,  and  it  becomes  strange, 
not  only  to  common  men  of  another  nationality,  but  to 
all  who  do  not  belong  to  the  circle  whose  members  have 
accustomed  themselves  to  certain  forms  of  harmonisation. 
So  that  music,  like  poetry,  travels  in  a  vicious  circle. 
Trivial  and  exclusive  melodies,  in  order  to  make  them  attrac 
tive,  are  laden  with  harmonic,  rhythmic,  and  orchestral  com 
plications,  and  thus  become  yet  more  exclusive,  and  far 
from  being  universal  are  not  even  national,  i.e.  they  are  not 
comprehensible  to  the  whole  people  but  only  to  some 
people. 
In  music,  besides  marches  and  dances  by  various  composers, 
which  satisfy  the  demands  of  universal  art,  one  can  indicate 
very  few  works  of  this  class :  Bach's  famous  violin  aria, 
Chopin's  nocturne  in  E  flat  major,  and  perhaps  a  dozen  bits 
(not  whole  pieces,  but  parts)  selected  from  the  works  of 
Haydn,  Mozart,  Schubert,  Beethoven,  and  Chopin.1 
Although  in  painting  the  same  thing  is  repeated  as  in 
poetry  and  in  music, â€” namely,  that  in  order  to  make  them 
more  interesting,  works  weak  in  conception  are  surrounded 
by  minutely  studied  accessories  of  time  and  place,  which 
give  them  a  temporary  and  local  interest  but  make  them 
1  While  offering  as  examples  of  art  those  that  seem  to  me  the  best, 
I  attach  no  special  importance  to  my  selection  ;  for,  besides  being 
insufficiently  informed  in  all  branches  of  art,  I  belong  to  the  class 
of  people  whose  taste  has,  by  false  training,  been  perverted.  And 
therefore  my  old,  inured  habits  may  cause  me  to  err,  and  I  may 
mistake  for  absolute  merit  the  impression  a  work  produced  on  me  in 
my  youth.  My  only  purpose  in  mentioning  examples  of  works  of  this 
or  that  class  is  to  make  my  meaning  clearer,  and  to  show  how, 
with  my  present  views,  I  understand  excellence  in  art  in  relation 
to  its  subject-matter.  I  must,  moreover,  mention  that  I  consign  my 
own  artistic  productions  to  the  category  of  bad  art,  excepting  the 
story  God  sees  tliz  Truth,  which  seeks  a  place  in  the  first  class,  and 
The  Prisoner  of  the  Caucasus,  which  belongs  to  the  second.
