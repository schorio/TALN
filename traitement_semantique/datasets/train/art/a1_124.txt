110 Chapter 6 Perceiving NatureThe painting in Figure 6–8 is done from an
interesting point of view. Look carefully at thiswork. Like those in the previous lesson, thisone provides a close-up view of nature. In thiscase, the subject is a tree. The point of view isfrom high among the branches. There is moreto the work, however. Did you notice the lonehuman figure in the painting? His red capstands out vividly against the mostly brownearth tones. He is a hunter. You won’t find hisprey—a bird—in the picture. That is becausethe bird sits in the branches, gazing down atthe hunter. You are seeing the scene throughthe bird’s eyes!WHATYOUWILLLEARN

scene as a bird might view it. Depending onwhere you live, the scene may be in the coun-try or city. You will include natural objects,such as mountains, fields, rivers, and streams,or objects made by people, such as buildings,streets, and trucks. After sketching the scenein chalk, you will add color by blending oilpastels. Use colors that give your picture acertain mood or feeling. As in Figure 6–8,your work will make use of different texturesto achieve variety.Drawing from a
