ures 3–8 and 3–9 on pages 46 and 47. Both areexamples of a type of artwork called portrait.
Aportrait is a visual representation of a person
at rest. Compare these two portraits with the
one in Figure 3–10. This artwork was done
with oil pastels. This is a medium with prop-erties of both drawing and painting media.Notice the delicate lines and soft tones in thiswork. See also how the artist used dark val-ues to shade some areas of the subject andlight values to highlight others. WHATYOUWILLLEARN
