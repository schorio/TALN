52  WHAT  IS  ART? 
understood  by  the  Mahommedans,  and  thus  is  it  still  under 
stood  by  religious  folk  among  our  own  peasantry. 
Some  teachers  of  mankind — as  Plato  in  his  Republic, 
and  people  such  as  the  primitive  Christians,  the  strict 
Mahommedans,  and  the  Buddhists — have  gone  so  far  as  to 
repudiate  all  art. 
People  viewing  art  in  this  way  (in  contradiction  to  the 
prevalent  view  of  to-day,  which  regards  any  art  as  good  if 
only  it  affords  pleasure)  considered,  and  consider,  that  art 
(as  contrasted  with  speech,  which  need  not  be  listened  to)  is  so 
highly  dangerous  in  its  power  to  infect  people  against  their 
wills,  that  mankind  will  lose  far  less  by  banishing  all  art 
than  by  tolerating  each  and  every  art. 
Evidently  such  people  were  wrong  in  repudiating  all 
art,  for  they  denied  that  which  cannot  be  denied — one  of 
the  indispensable  means  of  communication,  without  which 
mankind  could  not  exist.  But  not  less  wrong  are  the  people 
of  civilised  European  society  of  our  class  and  day,  in 
favouring  any  art  if  it  but  serves  beauty,  i.e.  gives  people 
pleasure. 
Formerly,  people  feared  lest  among  the  works  of  art 
there  might  chance  to  be  some  causing  corruption,  and  they 
prohibited  art  altogether.  Now,  they  only  fear  lest  they 
should  be  deprived  of  any  enjoyment  art  can  afford,  and 
patronise  any  art.  And  I  think  the  last  error  is  much 
grosser  than  the  first,  and  that  its  consequences  are  far 
more  harmful.
