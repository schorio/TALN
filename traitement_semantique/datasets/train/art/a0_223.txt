i8o  WHAT  IS  ART? 
mind  of  such  a  man  of  the  people  must  be  when  he  learns, 
from  such  rumours  and  newspapers  as  reach  him,  that  the 
clergy,  the  Government  officials,  and  all  the  best  people  in 
Russia  are  triumphantly  unveiling  a  statue  to  a  great  man, 
the  benefactor,  the  pride  of  Russia — Pushkin,  of  whom  till 
then  he  had  never  heard.  From  all  sides  ho  reads  or  hears 
about  this,  and  he  naturally  supposes  that  if  such  honours 
are  rendered  to  anyone,  then  without  doubt  he  must  have 
done  something  extraordinary — either  some  feat  of  strength 
or  of  goodness.  He  tries  to  learn  who  Pushkin  was,  and 
having  discovered  that  Pushkin  was  neither  a  hero  nor  a 
general,  but  was  a  private  person  and  a  writer,  he  comes  to 
the  conclusion  that  Pushkin  must  have  been  a  holy  man 
and  a  teacher  of  goodness,  and  he  hastens  to  read  or  to  hear 
his  life  and  works.  But  what  must  be  his  perplexity  when 
he  learns  that  Pushkin  was  a  man  of  more  than  easy 
morals,  who  was  killed  in  a  duel,  i.e.  when  attempting 
to  murder  another  man,  and  that  all  his  service  consisted 
in  writing  verses  about  love,  which  were  often  very 
indecent. 
That  a  hero,  or  Alexander  the  Great,  or  Genghis  Khan,  or 
Napoleon  were  great,  he  understands,  because  any  one  of  them 
could  have  crushed  him  and  a  thousand  like  him ;  that 
Buddha,  Socrates,  and  Christ  were  great  he  also  understands, 
for  he  knows  and  feels  that  he  and  all  men  should  be  such 
as  they  were  ;  but  why  a  man  should  be  great  because  he 
wrote  verses  about  the  love  of  women  he  cannot  make  out. 
A  similar  perplexity  must  trouble  the  brain  of  a  Breton 
or  Norman  peasant  who  hears  that  a  monument,  "  une 
statue  "  (as  to  the  Madonna),  is  being  erected  to  Baudelaire, and  reads,  or  is  told,  what  the  contents  of  his  Fleurs  du  Mai 
are ;  or,  more  amazing  still,  to  Yerlaine,  when  he  learns  the 
story  of  that  man's  wretched,  vicious  life,  and  reads  his verses.  And  what  confusion  it  must  cause  in  the  brains 
of  peasants  when  they  learn  that  some  Patti  or  Taglioni
