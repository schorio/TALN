Focus your attention on the triangular
shape looming on the horizon. You have prob-ably seen photographs of this structure before.It is one of the great pyramids of ancientEgypt. In and of itself, there is nothing strangeabout this landmark. It is when we look else-where in the painting that a sense of havingleft reality behind begins to emerge. Noticethe building at the left with the sharplypointed steeple. Buildings of this type are notfound in or near Egypt. Do you know wheresuch structures are found? Do you know whatthey are called?

M. C. Escher  (1898–1972)
Cultural connection. M. C. Escher had no
formal training in math or science, and he did
not think of himself as an artist or a mathema-tician. Even so, his artwork is analyzed andappreciated by mathematicians and scientists,as well as artists and the general public.
Maurits Cornelis Escher was born in 1898
in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands. He plannedto become an architect and studied at theSchool of Architecture and Decorative Arts inHaarlem. His interest soon switched to graphicarts, however. Escher is best known for printsthat combine precise, realistic detail withoptical illusions, repeating geometric patterns,and impossible spaces (see Figure 14–10 ).
Compare the strange juxtapositions in the
work in Figure 14–10 with Figure 14–11.
