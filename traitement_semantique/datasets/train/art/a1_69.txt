old magazines. Look for photos, illus-
trations, and words that go along withyour theme. Carefully remove the pagescontaining these images.
2.Think of other words or images that sup-
port your theme. Make sketches of theseimages. Transfer your best sketches towhite paper. Complete these drawingsusing crayon or marker.
3.Cut around the images you have selected
or created. Arrange these on the oak tag in an interesting way. You may want toalternate your original drawings withyour magazine clippings.
4.Next, cut shapes from construction paper.
These are to fill the spaces between yourimages. They are also to serve as back-ground. Add these around and under the images on the oak tag.
5.When you are satisfied with your design,
begin gluing the pieces. Start with theconstruction paper shapes. Work care-fully so as not to disturb the ungluedportions of your design. Use the gluesparingly. If any glue oozes out fromunder the pieces, carefully remove it witha slightly damp tissue. 
6.When your collage is dry, display it along
with those of your classmates. Challengeclassmates to identify your theme.
