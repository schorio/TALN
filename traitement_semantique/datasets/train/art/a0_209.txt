1 66  WHAT  IS  ART? 
and  therefore  unite  them.     Such  art  cannot,  in  our  time, 
but  be  esteemed  good,  for  it    attains   the   end  which  the 
"  religious  perception  of  our  time,  i.e.  Christianity,  sets  before humanity. 
Christian  art  either  evokes  in  men  those  feelings  which, 
through  love  of  God  and  of  one's  neighbour,  draw  them 
to  greater  and  ever  greater  union,  and  make  them  ready 
for  and  capable  of  such  union ;  or  evokes  in  them  those 
feelings  which  show  them  that  they  are  already  united  in 
the  joys  and  sorrows  of  life.  And  therefore  the  Christian 
art  of  our  time  can  be  and  is  of  two  kinds :  (1)  art  trans 
mitting  feelings  flowing  from  a  religious  perception  of 
man's  position  in  the  world  in  relation  to  God  and  to  his 
neighbour — religious  art  in  the  limited  meaning  of  the 
term;  and  (2)  art  transmitting  the  simplest  feelings  of 
common  life,  but  such,  always,  as  are  accessible  to  all  men 
in  the  whole  world — the  art  of  common  life — the  art  of  a 
J   people — universal  art.     Only  these  two  kinds  of  art  can  be 
\   considered  good  art  in  our  time. 
-~  '  The  first,  religious  art, — transmitting  both  positive  feelings 
of  love  to  God  and  one's  neighbour,  and  negative  feelings  of 
indignation  and  horror  at  the  violation  of  love, — manifests 
itself  chiefly  in  the  form  of  words,  and  to  some  extent  also 
in  painting  and  sculpture  :  the  second  kind  (universal  art) 
transmitting  feelings  accessible  to  all,  manifests  itself  in 
words,  in  painting,  in  sculpture,  in  dances,  in  architecture, 
and,  most  of  all,  in  music. 
If  I  were  asked  to  give  modern  examples  of  each  of  these 
kinds  of  art,  then,  as  examples  of  the  highest  art,  flowing 
from  love  of  God  and  man  (both  of  the  higher,  positive,  and 
of  the  lower,  negative  kind),  in  literature  I  should  name 
The  Robbers  by  Schiller :  Victor  Hugo's  Les  Pauvres  Gens and  Les  Miserables :  the  novels  and  stories  of  Dickens — 
The  Tale  of  Tioo  Cities,  The  Christmas  Carol,  The  Chimes, 
and  others :  UncU  Tom's  Cabin :  Dostoievsky's  works — •
