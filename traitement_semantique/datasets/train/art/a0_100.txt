WHAT  IS  ART?  57 
common  to  the  entire  people,  though,  for  our  times  a 
mean  art,  was,  nevertheless  a  true  one,  shared  by  the 
whole  community. 
And  this  was  the  state  of  things  until,  in  the  upper,  rich, 
more  educated  classes  of  European  society,  doubt  arose  as  to 
the  truth  of  that  understanding  of  life  which  was  expressed 
by  Church  Christianity.  When,  after  the  Crusades  and  the 
maximum  development  of  papal  power  and  its  abuses, 
people  of  the  rich  classes  became  acquainted  with  the  wisdom 
of  the  classics,  and  saw,  on  the  one  hand,  the  reasonable 
lucidity  of  the  teaching  of  the  ancient  sages,  and,  on  the 
other  hand,  the  incompatibility  of  the  Church  doctrine  with 
the  teaching  of  Christ,  they  lost  all  possibility  of  continuing 
to  believe  the  Church  teaching. 
If,  in  externals,  they  still  kept  to  the  forms  of  Church 
teaching,  they  could  no  longer  believe  in  it,  and  held  to  ib 
only  by  inertia  and  for  the  sake  of  influencing  the  masses, 
who  continued  to  believe  blindly  in  Church  doctrine,  and 
whom  the  upper  classes,  for  their  own  advantage,  considered 
it  necessary  to  support  in  those  beliefs. 
So  that  a  time  came  when  Church  Christianity  ceased  to 
be  the  general  religious  doctrine  of  all  Christian  people; 
some — the  masses — continued  blindly  to  believe  in  it,  but 
the  upper  classes — those  in  whose  hands  lay  the  power  and 
wealth,  and  therefore  the  leisure  to  produce  art  and  the 
means  to  stimulate  it — ceased  to  believe  in  that  teaching. 
In  respect  to  religion,  the  upper  circles  of  the  Middle  Ages 
found  themselves  in  the  same  position  in  which  the  educated 
Romans  were  before  Christianity  arose,  i.e.  they  no  longer 
believed  in  the  religion  of  the  masses,  but  had  no  beliefs  to 
put  in  place  of  the  worn-out  Church  doctrine  which  for  them 
had  lost  its  meaning. 
There  was  only  this  difference,  that  whereas  for  the 
Romans  who  lost  faith  in  their  emperor-gods  and  household- 
gods  it  was  impossible  to  extract  anything  further  from  all
