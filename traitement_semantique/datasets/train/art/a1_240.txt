226 Chapter 12 Telling a StoryWho am I? That question might at first
seem easy for most of us to answer. Carefulthought, however, reveals that each of us is acomplex, one-of-a-kind individual. The per-son you see when you look into the mirrorhas a story to tell unlike anyone else’s. Somewriters have, in fact, written entire booksabout themselves and their lives. These arecalled autobiographies.
The painting in Figure 12–4 is an auto-
biography of sorts. In this case, the artist hasanswered the question Who am I? without
using words. Study the painting. The artist haspainted herself three times. What differencescan you find among the three self-portraits?Notice the images—an eye, a shoe, a factory, achicken—which the artist has placed in frontof her own image. What meaning do you sup-pose she wants us to “read” into these?WHATYOUWILLLEARN
You will create your own “visual autobi-
ography” by illustrating themes from per-sonal experience. Think of qualities and traitsthat make up the one-of-a-kind individualthat is “you.” Use a combination of foundand original images to tell your story. Youwill emphasize the importance of events andobjects in your picture through size and colorcontrast.
