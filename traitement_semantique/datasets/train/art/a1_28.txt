14 Chapter 1 The Elements of ArtHere is a riddle. What do you, a stop sign,
and a rubber ball have in common? You allexist in—and are set off by—space. This istrue of all objects. Some objects are recogniz-able because of their shape or form alone.Even without seeing the letters or the redcolor, you could identify a stop sign. Youwould recognize its octagonal shape. Even inthe dark, you could identify a rubber ball.You would feel its round form.
Shape, form, and space are closely related.
In this lesson, you will learn about these ele-ments and their special place in art. 
SHAPE
To an artist, a shape is an area clearly set off
by one or more of the other six visual elements ofart.Shapes exist in two dimensions. Theyhave height and width but not depth. Shapes
are flat. 
All shapes are one of two types:
●Geometric shapes. Geometric shapes are
precise, mathematical shapes. They lookas though they were made with a ruler,compass, or other special tool. Thesquare, circle, and triangle are among themost common geometric shapes. Therectangle and oval are others. Geometric
shapes are mostly, though not always,made by people. Examine the painting inFigure 1–14. Which geometric shapes has
the artist used? How many of each ofthese shapes can you find in the work? 
●Free-form or organic shapes. Free-form
shapes are not regular or even. Suchshapes are found throughout nature.
