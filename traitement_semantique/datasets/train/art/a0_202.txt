WHAT  IS  ART?  15^ 
And  religions  have  always  furnished  that  guide.  All 
history  shows  that  the  progress  of  humanity  is  accomplished 
not  otherwise  than  under  the  guidance  of  religion.  But  if 
the  race  cannot  progress  without  the  guidance  of  religion, 
— and  progress  is  always  going  on,  and  consequently 
also  in  our  own  times, — then  there  must  be  a  religion 
of  our  times.  So  that,  whether  it  pleases  or  displeases 
the  so-called  cultured  people  of  to-day,  they  must  admit 
the  existence  of  religion — not  of  a  religious  cult,  Catholic, 
Protestant,  or  another,  but  of  religious  perception — which, 
even  in  our  times,  is  the  guide  always  present  where 
there  is  any  progress.  And  if  a  religious  perception  exists 
amongst  us,  then  our  art  should  be  appraised  on  the 
basis  of  that  religious  perception ;  and,  as  has  always 
and  everywhere  been  the  case,  art  transmitting  feelings 
flowing  from  the  religious  perception  of  our  time  should 
be  chosen  from  all  the  indifferent  art,  should  be  acknow 
ledged,  highly  esteemed,  and  encouraged ;  while  art  running 
counter  to  that  perception  should  be  condemned  and 
despised,  and  all  the  remaining  indifferent  art  should 
neither  be  distinguished  nor  encouraged. 
The  religious  perception  of  our  time,  in  its  widest  and 
most  practical  application,  is  the  consciousness  that  our  well- 
being,  both  material  and  spiritual,  individual  and  collective, 
temporal  and  eternal,  lies  in  the  growth  of  brotherhood 
among  all  men — in  their  loving  harmony  with  one  another. 
This  perception  is  not  only  expressed  by  Christ  and  all  the 
best  men  of  past  ages,  it  is  not  only  repeated  in  the  most 
varied  forms  and  from  most  diverse  sides  by  the  best  men 
of  our  own  times,  but  it  already  serves  as  a  clue  to  all  the 
complex  labour  of  humanity,  consisting  as  this  labour  does, 
on  the  one  hand,  in  the  destruction  of  physical  and  moral 
obstacles  to  the  union  of  men,  and,  on  the  other  hand,  in 
establishing  the  principles  common  to  all  men  which  can, 
and  should  unite  them  into  one  universal  brotherhood.'
