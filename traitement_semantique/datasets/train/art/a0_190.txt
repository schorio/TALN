WHAT  IS  ART?  147 
admirable  musician,  famed  for  his  execution  of  classical 
music,  and  particularly  of  Beethoven,  played  us  Beethoven's 
sonata,  Opus  101.  For  the  benefit  of  those  who  might 
otherwise  attribute  my  judgment  of  that  sonata  of  Beethoven 
to  non-comprehension  of  it,  I  should  mention  that  whatever 
other  people  understand  of  that  sonata  and  of  other 
productions  of  Beethoven's  later  period,  I,  being  very susceptible  to  music,  equally  understood.  For  a  long  time 
I  used  to  atune  myself  so  as  to  delight  in  those  shapeless 
improvisations  which  form  the  subject-matter  of  the  works 
of  Beethoven's  later  period,  but  I  had  only  to  consider  the 
question  of  art  seriously,  and  to  compare  the  impression 
I  received  from  Beethoven's  later  Avorks  with  those  pleasant, 
clear,  and  strong  musical  impressions  which  are  transmitted, 
for  instance,  by  the  melodies  of  Bach  (his  arias),  Haydn, 
Mozart,  Chopin  (when  his  melodies  are  not  overloaded 
with  complications  and  ornamention),  and  of  Beethoven 
himself  in  his  earlier  period,  and  above  all,  with  the 
impressions  produced  by  folk-songs, — Italian,  Norwegian, 
or  Russian, — by  the  Hungarian  tzar  das,  and  other  such 
simple,  clear,  and  powerful  music,  and  the  obscure,  almost 
unhealthy  excitement  from  Beethoven's  later  pieces  that  I 
had  artificially  evoked  in  myself  was  immediately  destroyed. 
On  the  completion  of  the  performance  (though  it  was 
noticeable  that  everyone  had  become  dull)  those  present,  in 
the  accepted  manner,  warmly  praised  Beethoven's  profound 
production,  and  did  not  forget  to  add  that  formerly  they 
had  not  been  able  to  understand  that  last  period  of  his, 
but  that  they  now  saw  that  he  was  really  then  at  his  very 
best.  And  when  I  ventured  to  compare  the  impression 
made  on  me  by  the  singing  of  the  peasant  women — an 
impression  which  had  been  shared  by  all  who  heard  it — with 
the  effect  of  this  sonata,  the  admirers  of  Beethoven  only 
smiled  contemptuously,  not  considering  it  necessary  to  reply 
to  such  strange  remarks.
