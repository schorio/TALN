CHAPTER   II 
FOR  the  production  of  every  ballet,  circus,  opera,  operetta, 
exhibition,  picture,  concert,  or  printed  book,  the  intense  and 
unwilling  labour  of  thousands  and  thousands  of  people  is 
needed  at  what  is  often  harmful  and  humiliating  work. 
It  were  well  if  artists  made  all  they  require  for  themselves, 
but,  as  it  is,  they  all  need  the  help  of  workmen,  not  only  to 
produce  art,  but  also  for  their  own  usually  luxurious  main 
tenance.  And,  one  way  or  other,  they  get  it ;  either  through 
payments  from  rich  people,  or  through  subsidies  given  by 
Government  (in  Russia,  for  instance,  in  grants  of  millions  of 
roubles  to  theatres,  conservatoires  and  academies).  This 
money  is  collected  from  the  people,  some  of  whom  have  to 
sell  their  only  cow  to  pay  the  tax,  and  who  never  get  those 
aesthetic  pleasures  which  art  gives. 
It  was  all  very  well  for  a  Greek  or  Roman  artist,  or  even 
for  a  Russian  artist  of  the  first  half  of  our  century  (when 
there  were  still  slaves,  and  it  was  considered  right  that  there 
should  be),  with  a  quiet  mind  to  make  people  serve  him  and 
his  art;  but  in  our  day,  when  in  all  men  there  is  at  least 
some  dim  perception  of  the  equal  rights  of  all,  it  is  impos 
sible  to  constrain  people  to  labour  unwillingly  for  art,  without 
first  deciding  the  question  whether  it  is  true  that  art  is  so 
good  and  so  important  an  affair  as  to  redeem  this  evil. 
If  not,  we  have  the  terrible  probability  to  consider,  that 
while  fearful  sacrifices  of  the  labour  and  lives  of  men,  and 
of  morality  itself,  are  being  made  to  art,  that  same  art  may 
be  not  only  useless  but  even  harmful.
