Taste is a personal matter. What is music to
one person might be noise to another. In art,differences in taste may be traced to aesthet-
ics(es-thet-iks). This is the study of the nature
of beauty and art. Aesthetics raises the question
“What makes a work of art successful?”
Over the centuries, thinkers seeking 
answers to this question have come up with different “aesthetic views” of art. Anaesthetic view is an idea or school of thought on
what is most important in a work of art. Histor-
ically, the debate among scholars has centeredon three competing aesthetic views. These arethe subject view, the composition view, and the
content view.SUBJECT VIEW
The subject view holds that a successful
artwork is one whose subject looks convinc-ing and lifelike. A work’s subject is an image
viewers can easily identify. The subject may be
a person or people, as in Figure 4–2. It may be
an object, such as a chair. It may even be anevent, such as a holiday celebration. Lookagain at the painting in Figure 4–2. Noticehow realistic the subject is. How do you thinka scholar taking the subject view would eval-uate this painting?
COMPOSITION VIEW
The second aesthetic view—the composi-
tion view—maintains that what counts mostin an artwork is its composition. This is the
way the principles of art are used to organize theelements of art. Supporters of the composition
view attach the most importance to how theparts of a work fit together. They would focuson an artwork’s formal properties, or the orga-
nization of the elements of art by the princi-ples of art. They might look, for example, at
