WHAT  IS  ART?  69 
The  art  we  have  is  the  whole  of  art,  the  real,  the  only 
art,  and  yet  two-thirds  of  the  human  race  (all  the  peoples 
of  Asia  and  Africa)  live  and  die  knowing  nothing  of  this 
sole  and  supreme  art.  And  even  in  our  Christian  society 
hardly  one  per  cent,  of  the  people  make  use  of  this  art  which 
we  speak  of  as  being  the  whole  of  art ;  the  remaining  ninety- 
nine  per  cent,  live  and  die,  generation  after  generation, 
crushed  by  toil  and  never  tasting  this  art,  which  moreover 
is  of  such  a  nature  that,  if  they  could  get  it,  they  would  not 
understand  anything  of  it.  We,  according  to  the  current 
aesthetic  theory,  acknowledge  art  either  as  one  of  the  highest 
manifestations  of  the  Idea,  God,  Beauty,  or  as  the  highest 
spiritual  enjoyment;  furthermore,  we  hold  that  all  people 
have  equal  rights,  if  not  to  material,  at  any  rate  to  spiritual 
well-being ;  and  yet  ninety-nine  per  cent,  of  our  European 
population  live  and  die,  generation  after  generation,  crushed 
by  toil,  much  of  which  toil  is  necessary  for  the  production  of 
our  art  which  they  never  use,  and  we,  nevertheless,  calmly 
assert  that  the  art  which  we  produce  is  the  real,  true,  only 
.  artâ€” all  of  art ! 
To  the  remark  that  if  our  art  is  the  true  art  everyone 
should  have  the  benefit  of  it,  the  usual  reply  is  that  if  not 
everybody  at  present  makes  use  of  existing  art,  the  fault 
lies,  not  in  the  art,  but  in  the  false  organisation  of  society ; 
that  one  can  imagine  to  oneself,  in  the  future,  a  state  of 
things  in  which  physical  labour  will  be  partly  superseded 
by  machinery,  partly  lightened  by  its  just  distribution,  and 
that  labour  for  the  production  of  art  will  be  taken  in  turns  ; 
that  there  is  no  need  for  some  people  always  to  sit  below  the 
stage  moving  the  decorations,  winding  up  the  machinery, 
working  at  the  piano  or  French  horn,  and  setting  type  and 
printing  books,  but  that  the  people  who  do  all  this  work 
might  be  engaged  only  a  few  hours  per  day,  and  in  their 
leisure  time  might  enjoy  all  the  blessings  of  art. 
That  is  what  the  defenders  of  our  exclusive  art  say.     But
