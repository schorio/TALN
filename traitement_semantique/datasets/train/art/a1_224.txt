210 Chapter 11 Recording EventsDuring a political campaign, newspapers
are filled with editorials—articles that try topersuade you to take a particular position.Television gives or sells time to candidates to
speak about their positions. Cartoonists alsouse their art form to try to persuade theirviewers. They use caricature (kar-ih-kuh-
chur), a humorous drawing that exaggerates 
features of a person to make fun of or criticize himor her.
The cartoon in Figure 11–8 uses the ele-
phant and the donkey to symbolize theRepublican and Democratic parties respec-tively. The cartoonist drew them as imageson an ancient Greek vase because democracybegan in ancient Greece. His title, Pandora’s
Ballot Box, adds another symbol. Do youknow the ancient Greek myth of Pandora’s
Box? Pandora was a very curious girl whoopened a forbidden box. By doing so she re-leased troubles into our world. What doesthis say about the election?
