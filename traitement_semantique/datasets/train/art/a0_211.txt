i6S  WHAT  IS  ART? 
and  the  beauty  of  the  picture  for  the  most  part  obscures  the 
feeling.  For  instance,  Gerome's  "Pollice  Yerso  "  expresses, 
not  so  much  horror  at  what  is  being  perpetrated  as  attrac 
tion  by  the  beauty  of  the  spectacle.1 
To  give  examples,  from  the  modern  art  of  our  upper 
classes,  of  art  of  the  second  kind,  good  universal  art  or  even 
of  the  art  of  a  whole  people,  is  yet  more  difficult,  especially 
in  literary  art  and  music.  If  there  .are  some  works  which 
by  their  inner  contents  might  be  assigned  to  this  class 
(such  as  Don  Quixote,  Moliere's  comedies,  David  Copperfield 
and  The  Pickwick  Papers  by  Dickens,  Gogol's  and  Pushkin's 
tales,  and  some  things  of  Maupassant's),  these  works  are  for 
the  most  part — from  the  exceptional  nature  of  the  feelings 
they  transmit,  and  the  superfluity  of  special  details  of  time 
and  locality,  and,  above  all,  on  account  of  the  poverty  of  their 
subject-matter  in  comparison  with  examples  of  universal 
ancient  art  (such,  for  instance,  as  the  story  of  Joseph) — 
comprehensible  only  to  people  of  their  own  circle.  That 
Joseph's  brethren,  being  jealous  of  his  father's  afiection,  sell 
him  to  the  merchants ;  that  Potiphar's  wife  wishes  to  tempt 
the  youth  ;  that  having  attained  the  highest  station,  he  takes 
pity  on  his  brothers,  including  Benjamin  the  favourite, — 
these  and  all  the  rest  are  feelings  accessible  alike  to  a 
liussian  peasant,  a  Chinese,  an  African,  a  child,  or  an  old 
man,  educated  or  uneducated;  and  it  is  all  written  with 
such  restraint,  is  so  free  from  any  superfluous  detail,  that 
the  story  may  be  told  to  any  circle  and  will  be  equally 
comprehensible  and  touching  to  everyone.  But  not  such  are 
the  feelings  of  Don  Quixote  or  of  Moliere's  heroes  (though 
Moliere  is  perhaps  the  most  universal,  and  therefore  the 
most  excellent,  artist  of  modern  times),  nor  of  Pickwick 
and  his  friends.  These  feelings  are  not  common  to  all 
1  In  this  picture  the  spectators  in  the  Roman  Amphitheatre  are 
turning  down  their  thumbs  to  show  that  they  wish  the  vanquished 
gladiator  to  be  killed. — Trans.
