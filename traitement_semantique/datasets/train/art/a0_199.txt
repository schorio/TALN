How  in  art  are  we  to  decide  what  is  good  and  what  is 
bad  in  subject-matter? 
Art,   like    speech,    is   a   means   of    communication,    and 
I  therefore  of   progress,  i.e.   of  the  movement  of   humanity 
\  forward  towards  perfection.      Speech  renders  accessible  to 
men  of  the  latest  generations  all  the  knowledge  discovered 
by  the  experience  and  reflection,  both  of  preceding  genera 
tions  and  of  the  best  and  foremost  men  of  their  own  times ; 
art  renders  accessible  to  men  of  the  latest  generations  all 
|  the  feelings  experienced  by  their  predecessors,  and  those 
I  also  which  are  being  felt  by  their  best  and  foremost  con- 
l  temporaries,     And  as  the  evolution  of  knowledge  proceeds 
by   truer   and   more   necessary   knowledge    dislodging  and 
replacing  what  is  mistaken  and  unnecessary,  so  the  evolu 
tion  of  feeling  proceeds  through  art, â€” feelings  less  kind  and 
/less  needful  for  the  well-being  of  mankind  are  replaced  by 
'others  kinder  and  more  needful  for  that  end.     That  is  the 
purpose  of  art.      And,  speaking  now  of  its  subject-matter, 
the  more  art  fulfils  that  purpose  the  better  the  art,  and  the 
less  it  fulfils  it  the  worse  the  art. 
And  the  appraisement  of  feelings  (i.e.  the  acknowledgment 
of  these  or  those  feelings  as  being  more  or  less  good,  more 
or  less  necessary  for  the  well-being  of  mankind)  is  made  by 
ifhe  religious  perception  of  the  age. 
i  In  every  period  of  history,  and  in  every  human  society, 
there  exists  an  understanding  of  the  meaning  of  life  which 
represents  the  highest  level  to  which  men  of  that  society 156
