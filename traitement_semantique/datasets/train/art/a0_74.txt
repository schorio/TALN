WHAT  IS  ART?  31 
Morality,  of  Faith,  of  Politics,  and  of  Beauty;  and  activity 
in  the  last-named  realm  is  art.1 
According  to  Helmholtz  (1821),  who  wrote  on  beauty  as 
it  relates  to  music,  beauty  in  musical  productions  is  attained 
only  by  following  unalterable  laws.  These  laws  are  not 
known  to  the  artist;  so  that  beauty  is  manifested  by  the 
artist  unconsciously,  and  cannot  be  subjected  to  analysis.2 
According  to  Bergmann  (1840)  (Ueber  das  ScJione,  1887), 
to  define  beauty  objectively  is  impossible.  Beauty  is  only 
perceived  subjectively,  and  therefore  the  problem  of  aesthetics 
is  to  define  what  pleases  whom.3 
According  to  Jungmann  (d.  1885),  firstly,  beauty  is  a 
suprasensible  quality  of  things ;  secondly,  beauty  produces 
in  us  pleasure  by  merely  being  contemplated ;  and,  thirdly, 
beauty  is  the  foundation  of  love.4 
The  aesthetic  theories  of  the  chief  representatives  of  France, 
England,  and  other  nations  in  recent  times  have  been  the 
following : â€” 
In  France,  during  this  period,  the  prominent  writers  on 
aesthetics  were  Cousin,  Jouffroy,  Pictet,  Eavaisson,  Leveque. 
Cousin  (1792-1867)  was  an  eclectic,  and  a  follower  of  the 
German  idealists.  According  to  his  theory,  beauty  always 
has  a  moral  foundation.  He  disputes  the  doctrine  that  art 
is  imitation  and  that  the  beautiful  is  what  pleases.  He 
affirms  that  beauty  may  be  defined  objectively,  and  that  it 
essentially  consists  in  variety  in  unity.5 
After  Cousin  came  Jouffroy  (1796-1842),  who  was  a  pupil 
of  Cousin's  and  also  a  follower  of  the  German  sestheticians. 
According  to  his  definition,  beauty  is  the  expression  of  the 
invisible  by  those  natural  signs  which  manifest  it.  The 
visible  world  is  the  garment  by  means  of  which  we  see  beauty.6
