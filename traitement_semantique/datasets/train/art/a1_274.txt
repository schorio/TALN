celebration.
or many people, Thanksgiving wouldn’t be the same
without the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New
York City. Millions of people gaze at the colorful floats and
giant balloons that soar among the city’s skyscrapers.
John Piper is the man behind the floats and balloons.
He designs them all and oversees the 20 people who help
him dream up the holiday displays. In a warehouse in
Hoboken, New Jersey, Piper and his team sketch
ideas and make small models before building
full-scale versions. 
At parade time, Piper’s staff grows to more
than 300 people. It takes them about two
hours to fill each balloon with helium.
Workers keep the balloons grounded
with nets and sandbags. “The cur-
tain goes up at 9 A.M.
Thanksgiving morning,
no matter what,” hesays. But the crowd’sresponse to the works
of art rolling or floatingby “lifts the spiritsabove and beyondeverything else.”Some balloons, like Charlie
Brown, are old favorites butJohn Piper and his team alsomake new ones each year.Piper says the charactersmust be “exciting, fresh, and
timeless.”
