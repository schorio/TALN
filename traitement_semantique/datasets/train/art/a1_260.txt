246 Chapter 13 CelebrationsThe painting you looked at in Figure 13–2
celebrates a milestone in the growth of ournation. The work in Figure 13–4 celebrates
eight such milestones. On the surface, the
painting shows a simple and distinctly Amer-ican pastime—a quilting bee. Eight womenappear seated around the quilt they havesewn. A deeper meaning begins to formwhen the viewer learns the identities of theseindividuals. The figure in the blue suit at thecenter is Harriet Tubman. The person in thepolka-dot dress to her left is Rosa Parks. Whatpersonal sacrifices did these women make?What did they fight for?
