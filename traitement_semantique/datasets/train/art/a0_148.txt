WHAT  IS  ART?  105 
call  it    "  art,"  as  is  actually  being   done   by  the   so-called Decadents. 
The    direction    art    has    taken    may    be    compared    to 
placing  on  a  large  circle  other  circles,  smaller  and  smaller,/ 
until  a  cone  is  formed,  the  apex  of  which  is  no  longer  al 
circle  at  all.     That  is  what  has  happened  to  the  art  of  our^ 
times.
