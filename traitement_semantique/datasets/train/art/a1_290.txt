George Lucas brings fantasy
to the big screen.
eorge Lucas’s Star Wars movies reveal 
his lifelong love of fantasy. The film
director was inspired by comic books andfilms that he enjoyed as a young boy. He alsostudied fairy tales and ancient mythology. He turned these and other bits of his space-age dreams into Star Wars . 
Star Wars broke new technical ground.
Lucas had to start his own special-effectslaboratory, Industrial Light and Magic, toinvent new ways of creating fantasy. His2002 Star Wars film, Attack of the Clones ,
was the first major movie to usedigital high-definition video cameras.To film his vision, Lucas had to
convince two companies to buildthe new cameras from scratch.The success of Lucas’s experi-ment allowed film technology torapidly evolve. As the film ani-mator Jason Barlow explains,“Now with digitaltechnology realmagic canhappen.”
