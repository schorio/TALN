CHAPTER  VIII 
BUT  if  art  is  a  human  activity  having  for  its  purpose  the 
transmission  to  others  of  the  highest  and  best  feelings  to 
which  men  have  risen,  how  could  it  be  that  humanity 
for  a  certain  rather  considerable  period  of  its  existence 
(from  the  time  people  ceased  to  believe  in  Church  doctrine 
down  to  the  present  day)  should  exist  without  this  im 
portant  activity,  and,  instead  of  it,  should  put  up  with  an 
insignificant  artistic  activity  only  affording  pleasure  ? 
In  order  to  answer  this  question,  it  is  necessary,  first  of 
all,  to  correct  the  current  error  people  make  in  attributing 
to  our  art  the  significance  of  true,  universal  art.  We  are 
so  accustomed,  not  only  naively  to  consider  the  Circassian 
family  the  best  stock  of  people,  but  also  the  Anglo-Saxon 
race  the  best  race  if  we  are  Englishmen  or  Americans,  or 
the  Teutonic  if  we  are  Germans,  or  the  Gallo-Latin  if  we  are 
French,  or  the  Slavonic  if  we  are  Russians,  that  when 
speaking  of  our  own  art  we  feel  fully  convinced,  not  only 
that  our  art  is  true  art,  but  even  that  it  is  the  best  and  only 
true  art.  But  in  reality  our  art  is  not  only  not  the  only  art 
(as  the  Bible  once  was  held  to  be  the  only  book),  but  it  is 
not  even  the  art  of  the  whole  of  Christendom, â€” only  of  a 
small  section  of  that  part  of  humanity.  It  was  correct  to 
speak  of  a  national  Jewish,  Grecian,  or  Egyptian  art,  and  one 
may  speak  of  a  now-existing  Chinese,  Japanese,  or  Indian  art 
shared  in  by  a  whole  people.  Such  art,  common  to  a  whole 
nation,  existed  in  Russia  till  Peter  the  First's  time,  and  existed 
in  the  rest  of  Europe  until  the  thirteenth  or  fourteenth 67
