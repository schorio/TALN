Look back at the Egyptian relief sculpture
in Figure 5–2 on page 82. This work teachesus about the ancient Egyptian system of 
beliefs. The same may be said of the paintingin Figure 5–5. The work is from the tomb of
an Egyptian pharaoh named Sethos. He is thefigure pictured on the right. With him is thegoddess Hathor. According to Egyptianmyth, Hathor was the goddess of the sky. Shewas also queen of heaven. It appears thatHathor is about to take the pharaoh’s hand,as if to lead him somewhere. Where mightshe be preparing to lead the fallen pharaoh?
Look more closely at this painting. Did
you notice the abstract shapes in the roundedboxes? They appear in the picture above thehead of Sethos. These are examples of hiero-
glyphic (hy-ruh- glif-ik). This is an early form
of picture writing. Perhaps these “words” iden-
tified the object that the goddess is handing tothe pharaoh.
