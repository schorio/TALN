CHAPTER  V 
WHAT  is  art,  if  we  put  aside  the  conception  of  beauty, 
which  confuses  the  whole  matter  1  The  latest  and  most  com 
prehensible  definitions  of  art,  apart  from  the  conception  of 
beauty,  are  the  following : â€” (1  a)  Art  is  an  activity  arising 
even  in  the  animal  kingdom,  and  springing  from  sexual 
desire  and  the  propensity  to  play  (Schiller,  Darwin,  Spencer), 
and  (1  b)  accompanied  by  a  pleasurable  excitement  of  the 
nervous  system  (Grant  Allen).  This  is  the  physiological- 
evolutionary  definition.  (2)  Art  is  the  external  manifestation, 
by  means  of  lines,  colours,  movements,  sounds,  or  words, 
of  emotions  felt  by  man  (V6ron).  This  is  the  experimental 
definition.  According  to  the  very  latest  definition  (Sully), 
(3)  Art  is  "the  production  of  some  permanent  object,  or 
passing  action,  which  is  fitted  not  only  to  supply  an  active 
enjoyment  to  the  producer,  but  to  convey  a  pleasurable 
impression  to  a  number  of  spectators  or  listeners,  quite  apart 
from  any  personal  advantage  to  be  derived  from  it." 
Notwithstanding  the  superiority  of  these  definitions  to  the 
metaphysical  definitions  which  depended  on  the  conception 
of  beauty,  they  are  yet  far  from  exact.  (1  a)  The  first,  the 
physiological-evolutionary  definition,  is  inexact,  because, 
instead  of  speaking  about  the  artistic  activity  itself,  which 
is  the  real  matter  in  hand,  it  treats  of  the  derivation  of  art. 
The  modification  of  it  (1  6),  based  on  the  physiological  effects 
on  the  human  organism,  is  inexact,  because  within  the  limits 
of  such  definition  many  other  human  .ctrvities  can  be 
included,  as  has  occurred  in  the  neo-aesthetic  theories,  which 46
