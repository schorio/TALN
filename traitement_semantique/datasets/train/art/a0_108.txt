WHAT  IS  ART?  65 
section  of  society.  Such,  for  instance,  was  the  celebrated  and 
unfounded  theory  expounded  by  Malthus,  of  the  tendency 
of  the  population  of  the  world  to  increase  in  geometrical 
progression,  but  of  the  means  of  sustenance  to  increase  only 
in  arithmetical  progression,  and  of  the  consequent  over 
population  of  the  world ;  such,  also,  was  the  theory  (an 
outgrowth  of  the  Malthusian)  of  selection  and  struggle  for 
existence  as  the  basis  of  human  progress.  Such,  again,  is 
.Marx's  theory,  which  regards  the  gradual  destruction  of 
small  private  production  by  large  capitalistic  production 
now  going  on  around  us,  as  an  inevitable  decree  of  fate. 
However  unfounded  such  theories  are,  however  contrary  to 
all  that  is  known  and  confessed  by  humanity,  and  however 
obviously  immoral  they  may  be,  they  are  accepted  with 
credulity,  pass  uncriticised,  and  are  preached,  perchance 
for  centuries,  until  the  conditions  are  destroyed  which  they 
served  to  justify,  or  until  their  absurdity  has  become  too 
evident.  To  this  class  belongs  this  astonishing  theory  of 
the  Baumgartenian.  Trinity — Goodness,  Beauty,  and  Truth, 
according  to  which  it  appears  that  the  very  best  that  can  be 
done  by  the  art  of  nations  after  1900  years  of  Christian 
teaching,  is  to  choose  as  the  ideal  of  their  life  the  ideal  that 
was  held  by  a  small,  semi-savage,  slave-holding  people 
who  lived  2000  years  ago,  who  imitated  the  nude  human 
body  extremely  well,  and  erected  buildings  pleasant  to  look 
at.  All  these  incompatibilities  pass  completely  unnoticed. 
Learned  people  write  long,  cloudy  treatises  on  beauty  as  a 
member  of  the  aesthetic  trinity  of  Beauty,  Truth,  and  Good 
ness  ;  das  Schone,  das  Wahre,  das  Gute ;  le  Beau,  le  Vrai, 
Ic  Bon,  are  repeated,  with  capital  letters,  by  philosophers, 
restheticians  and  artists,  by  private  individuals,  by  novelists 
and  by  feuilletonistes,  and  they  all  think,  when  pronouncing 
these  sacrosanct  words,  that  they  speak  of  something  quite 
definite  and  solid — something  on  which  they  can  base  their  : 
opinions.  In  reality,  these  words  not  only  have  no  definite
