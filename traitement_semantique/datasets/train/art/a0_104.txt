CHAPTER  VII 
FROM  the  time  that  people  of  the  upper  classes  lost  faith  in 
Church  Christianity,  beauty  (i.e.  the  pleasure  received  from 
art)  became  their  standard  of  good  and  bad  art.  And,  in 
accordance  with  that  view,  an  aesthetic  theory  naturally  sprang 
up  among  those  upper  classes  justifying  such  a  conception,  — 
a  theory  according  to  which  the  aim  of  art  is  to  exhibit 
beauty.  The  partisans  of  this  aesthetic  theory,  in  confirma 
tion  of  its  truth,  affirmed  that  it  was  no  invention  of  their 
own,  but  that  it  existed  in  the  nature  of  things,  and  was 
recognised  even  by  the  ancient  Greeks.  But  this  assertion 
was  quite  arbitrary,  and  has  no  foundation  other  than  the 
fact  that  among  the  ancient  Greeks,  in  consequence  of 
the  low  grade  of  their  moral  ideal  (as  compared  with  the 
Christian),  their  conception  of  the  good,  TO  <lya#6V,  was  not 
yet  sharply  divided  from  their  conception  of  the  beautiful, 
That  highest  perfection  of  goodness  (not  only  not  identical 
with  beauty,  but,  for  the  most  part,  contrasting  with  it)  which 
was  discerned  by  the  Jews  even  in  the  times  of  Isaiah,  and 
fully  expressed  by  Christianity,  was  quite  unknown  to  the 
Greeks.  They  supposed  that  the  beautiful  must  necessarily 
also  be  the  good.  It  is  true  that  their  foremost  thinkers  — 
Socrates,  Plato,  Aristotle  —  felt  that  goodness  may  happen  not 
to  coincide  with  beauty.  Socrates  expressly  subordinated 
beauty  to  goodness;  Plato,  to  unite  the  two  conception?, 
spoke  of  spiritual  beauty  ;  while  Aristotle  demanded  from  art 
that  it  should  have  a  moral  influence  on  people  (/ca#apo-is).
