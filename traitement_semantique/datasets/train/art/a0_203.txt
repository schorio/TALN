t -jo  WHAT  IS  ART? 
And  it  is  on  the  basis  of  this  perception  that  we  should 
appraise  all  the  phenomena  of  our  life,  and,  among  the  rest, 
our  art  also ;  choosing  from  all  its  realms  whatever  transmits 
feelings  flowing  from  this  religious  perception,  highly  prizing 
and  encouraging  such  art,  rejecting  whatever  is  contrary  to 
this  perception,  and  not  attributing  to  the  rest  of  art  an 
importance  not  properly  pertaining  to  it. 
The  chief  mistake  made  by  people  of  the  upper  classes 
of  the  time  of  the  so-called  Renaissance, — a  mistake  which 
we  still  perpetuate, — was  not  that  they  ceased  to  value  and 
to  attach  importance  to  religious  art  (people  of  that  period 
could  not  attach  importance  to  it,  because,  like  our  own 
i  upper  classes,  they  could  not  believe  in  what  the  majority 
\  considered  to  be  religion),  but  their  mistake  was  that  they 
'set   up    in   place    of   religious    art   which  was  lacking,   an 
{insignificant    art  which  aimed  only  at  giving  pleasure,  i.e. 
they  began  to  choose,  to  value,  and  to  encourage,  in  place 
of  religious  art,  something  which,  in  any  case,  did  not  deserve 
such  esteem  and  encouragement. 
One  of  the  Fathers  of  the  Church  said  that  the  great 
evil  is  not  that  men  do  not  know  God,  but  that  they  have 
set  up,  instead  of  God,  that  which  is  not  God.  So  also  with 
art.  The  great  misfortune  of  the  people  of  the  upper 
classes  of  our  time  is  not  so  much  that  they  are  without  a 
religious  art,  as  that,  instead  of  a  supreme  religious  art, 
I  chosen  from  all  the  rest  as  being  specially  important  and 
valuable,  they  have  chosen  a  most  insignificant  and,  usually, 
harmful  art,  which  aims  at  pleasing  certain  people,  and 
which,  therefore,  if  only  by  its  exclusive  nature,  stands  in 
contradiction  to  that  Christian  principle  of  universal  union 
which  forms  the  religious  perception  of  our  time.  Instead 
of  religious  art,  an  empty  and  often  vicious  art  is  set  up, 
and  this  hides  from  men's  notice  the  need  of  that  true 
religious  art  which  should  be  present  in  life  ID  order  to 
improve  it.
