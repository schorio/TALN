i88  WHAT  IS  ART? 
permeated  by  the  spirit  of  that  teaching,  and,  consciously 
or  unconsciously,  is  guided  by  it. 
However  differently  in  form  people  belonging  to  our 
Christian  world  may  define  the  destiny  of  man;  whether 
they  see  it  in  human  progress  in  whatever  sense  of  the 
words,  in  the  union  of  all  men  in  a  socialistic  realm,  or 
in  the  establishment  of  a  commune  ;  whether  they  look 
forward  to  the  union  of  mankind  under  the  guidance  of 
one  universal  Church,  or  to  the  federation  of  the  world, — 
however  various  in  form  their  definitions  of  the  destination 
of  human  life  may  be,  all  men  in  our  times  already  admit 
that  the  highest  well  -being  attainable  by  men  is  to  be 
reached  by  their  union  with  one  another. 
However  people  of  our  upper  classes  (feeling  that  their 
ascendency  can  only  be  maintained  as  long  as  they  separate 
themselves — the  rich  and  learned — from  the  labourers,  the 
poor,  and  the  unlearned)  may  seek  to  devise  new  conceptions 
of  life  by  which  their  privileges  may  be  perpetuated, — now 
the  ideal  of  returning  to  antiquity,  now  mysticism,  now 
Hellenism,  now  the  cult  of  the  superior  person  (over 
man-ism), — they  have,  willingly  or  unwillingly,  to  admit  the 
truth  which  is  elucidating  itself  from  all  sides,  voluntarily 
and  involuntarily,  namely,  that  our  welfare  lies  only  in  the 
unification  and  the  brotherhood  of  man. 
Unconsciously  this  truth  is  confirmee!  by  the  construction  of 
means  of  communication, — telegraphs,  telephones,  the  press, 
and  the  ever-increasing  attainability  of  material  well-being  for 
everyone, — and,  consciously  it  is  affirmed  by  the  destruction 
of  ^superstitions  which  divide  men,  by  the  \diffusion  of  the 
truths  of  knowledge,. and  by  the  expression  of  the  ideal  of 
the  brotherhood  of  man  in  the  best  works  of  art  of  our  time. 
Art  is  a  spiritual  organ  of  human  life  which  cannot  be 
destroyed,  and  therefore,  notwithstanding  all  the  efforts 
made  by  people  of  the  upper  classes  to  conceal  the  religious 
ideal  by  which  humanity  lives,  that  ideal  is  more  and  more
