236 Chapter 12 Telling a StoryAs mentioned earlier, some stories are told
in words, others in pictures. In this lesson, youwill look at picture stories that co-exist suc-cessfully side by side with the printed word.Pictures of this kind appear scattered through-out the book you are holding at this moment.They are called book illustrations.
MANUSCRIPT ILLUSTRATION
The practice of illustrating books goes back
some 1,100 years. The earliest such illustra-tions were tiny paintings known as illumina-
tions. They were so called because their job
was to illuminate—or shed light on—thewords on the page. Illuminations were com-mon in Europe at a time when most peoplecould not read. These illustrations thus serveda function that went beyond mere decoration.Do you recall the name for art of this type?The object in Figure 12–14 is an illumi-
nated page from a book produced around theturn of the fifteenth century. This book wascalled a missal (mis-uhl). Its purpose was to
teach. The bulk of the instruction was pro-vided by miniature framed images of the sortappearing at the top of the page shown. No-tice the richly colored border of fancifulplants and creatures. Each of these objectswas individually hand-painted. What kind oflessons do you think missals taught? Do youknow the story narrated by the framed pic-ture on this missal page?
BOOKILLUSTRATION OF TODAY
The invention of the printing press in 
the 1400s changed for all time the way books were made and illustrated. At first, all illustrations were done as woodcuts.
