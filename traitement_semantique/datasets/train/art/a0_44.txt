TAKE  up  any  one  of  our  ordinary  newspapers,  and  you 
will  find  a  part  devoted  to  the  theatre  and  music.  In 
almost  every  number  you  will  find  a  description  of  some 
art  exhibition,  or  of  some  particular  picture,  and  you  will 
always  find  reviews  of  new  works  of  art  that  have  appeared, 
of  volumes  of  poems,  of  short  stories,  or  of  novels. 
Promptly,  and  in  detail,  as  soon  as  it  has  occurred,  an 
account  is  published  of  how  such  and  such  an  actress  or 
actor  played  this  or  that  role  in  such  and  such  a  drama, 
comedy,  or  opera ;  and  of  the  merits  of  the  performance,  as 
well  as  of  the  contents  of  the  new  drama,  comedy,  or  opera, 
with  its  defects  and  merits.  With  as  much  care  and  detail, 
or  even  more,  we  are  told  how  such  and  such  an  artist 
has  sung  a  certain  piece,  or  has  played  it  on  the  piano  or 
violin,  and  what  were  the  merits  and  defects  of  the  piece 
and  of  the  performance.  In  every  large  town  there  is  sure 
to  be  at  least  one,  if  not  more  than  one,  exhibition  of  new 
pictures,  the  merits  and  defects  of  which  are  discussed  in 
the  utmost  detail  by  critics  and  connoisseurs. 
New  novels  and  poems,  in  separate  volumes  or  in  the 
magazines,  appear  almost  every  day,  and  the  newspapers 
consider  it  their  duty  to  give  their  readers  detailed  accounts 
of  these  artistic  productions.
