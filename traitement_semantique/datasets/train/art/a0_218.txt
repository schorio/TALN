CHAPTER     XVII 
ART  is  one  of  two  organs  of  human  progress.  By  words  man 
interchanges  thoughts,  by  the  forms  of  art  he  interchanges 
feelings,  and  this  with  all  men,  not  only  of  the  present 
time,  but  also  of  the  past  and  the  future.  It  is  natural  to 
human  beings  to  employ  both  these  organs  of  intercom 
munication,  and  therefore  the  perversion  of  either  of  them 
must  cause  evil  results  to  the  society  in  which  it  occurs. 
And  these  results  will  be  of  two  kinds :  first,  the  absence, 
in  that  society,  of  the  work  which  should  be  performed  by 
the  organ ;  and  secondly,  the  harmful  activity  of  the  per 
verted  organ.  And  just  these  results  have  shown  them 
selves  in  our  society.  The  organ  of  art  has  been  perverted, 
and  therefore  the  upper  classes  of  society  have,  to  a  great 
extent,  been  deprived  of  the  work  that  it  should  have 
performed.  The  diffusion  in  our  society  of  enormous 
quantities  of,  on  the  one  hand,  those  counterfeits  of  art 
which  only  serve  to  amuse  and  corrupt  people,  arid,  on 
the  other  hand,  of  works  of  insignificant,  exclusive  art, 
mistaken  for  the  highest  art,  have  perverted  most  men's 
capacity  to  be  infected  by  true  works  of  art,  and  have 
thus  deprived  them  of  the  possibility  of  experiencing  the 
highest  feelings  to  which  mankind  has  attained,  and  which 
can  only  be  transmitted  from  man  to  man  by  art. 
All  the  best  that  has  been  done  in  art  by  man  remains 
strange  to  people  who  lack  the  capacity  to  be  infected  by 
art,  and  is  replaced  either  by  spurious  counterfeits  of  art 
or  by  insignificant  art,  which  they  mistake  for  real  art. 175
