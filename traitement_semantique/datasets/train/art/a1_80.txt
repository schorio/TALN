66 Chapter 4 Looking at ArtDo you enjoy solving mysteries? Maybe
you are a fan of brainteasers. In either case,having all the facts at hand is critical to find-ing a solution. So is arranging the facts in alogical fashion.
These statements apply not only to “who-
dunits” and puzzles. They also apply to art-works. In getting to the “bottom” of a work ofart, you need to follow a series of orderedsteps. In this lesson, you will learn aboutthese steps and about the solutions theyyield. You will also learn how to apply thesesteps to your own works of art.THEARTCRITIC
As an amateur detective, you use evi-
dence and clues to crack a case. In a sense, artcritics do the same. An art critic is a person
whose job is studying, understanding, and judg-ing works of art. In getting this job done, crit-
ics will use all three aesthetic views.
When studying a work of art, the critic
uses a four-step process. These steps are describing, analyzing, interpreting, and judging.
The first three of these steps, as you will see,correspond to the three aesthetic views.
