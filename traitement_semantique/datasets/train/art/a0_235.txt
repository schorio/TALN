CHAPTER    XIX 
PEOPLE  talk  of  the  art  of  the  future,  meaning  by  "  art  of 
the  future  "  some  especially  refined,  new  art,  which,  as  they 
imagine,  will  be  developed  out  of  that  exclusive  art  of  one 
class  which  is  now  considered  the  highest  art.  But  no  such 
new  art  of  the  future  can  or  will  be  found.  Our  exclusive 
art,  that  of  the  upper  classes  of  Christendom,  has  found  its 
way  into  a  blind  alley.  The  direction  in  which  it  has  been 
going  leads  nowhere.  Having  once  let  go  of  that  which  is 
most  essential  for  art  (namely,  the  guidance  given  by 
^  \religious  perception),  that  art  has  become  ever  more  and 
more  exclusive,  and  therefore  ever  more  and  more  perverted, 
until,  finally,  it  has  come  tojnothing.  The  art  of  the  future, 
that  which  is  really  coming,  will  not  be  a  development  of 
present-day  art,  but  will  arise  on  completely  other  and  ne^J 
"\foundations^  having  nothing  in  common  with  those  by  which our  present  art  of  the  upper  classes  is  guided. 
Art  of  the  future,  that  is  to  say,  such  part  of  art  as 
will  be  chosen  from  among  all  the  art  diffused  among  man 
kind,  will  consist,  not  in  transmitting  feelings  accessible  only 
to  members  of  the  rich  classes,  as  is  the  case  to-day,  but  in 
transmitting  such  feelings  as  embody  the  highest  religious 
perception  of  our  times.  Only  those  productions  will  be 
considered  art  which  transmit  feelings  drawing  men  together 
in  brotherly  union,  or  such  universal  feelings  as  can  unite  all 
,jmen.  Only  such  art  will  be  chosen,  tolerated,  approved,  and 
diffused.  But  a*t  transmitting  feelings  flowing  from  anti 
quated,  worn-out  religious  teaching, â€” Church  art,  patriotic  art, 192
