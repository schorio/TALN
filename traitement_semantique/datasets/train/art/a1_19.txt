“reads” all the elements together. In fact, it is
the careful blending of elements that allowsyou to see an artwork as the artist meant it tobe seen. Taken together, the elements in Figure1–2 “add up” to a basket of apples and a bot-tle. The lines in Figure 1–3 cleverly suggest afamiliar farm animal. Can you identify it?
“Reading” the Artist’s
Vocabulary
Think back to when you first learned to
read. You did not start with a book. Rather,
you began by reading a word at a time. Thisis how you will learn the vocabulary of art.You will learn about the elements of art one
at a time. 
Each of the remaining lessons in this chap-
ter treats one or more elements. In later chap-ters, you will learn about other terms that arecentral to the practice and study of art. 
Lesson 1 The Language of Art 5
Paul Cézanne (1839–1906)
Cultural connection. Although he is
sometimes associated with the FrenchImpressionist painters, Paul Cézanne was aleader in the movement toward abstractionin painting that became known as Post-Impressionism.
Born in Aix-en-Provence, France, in 1839,
Cézanne exhibited a few times with ClaudeMonet, Auguste Renoir, and CamillePissarro. It soon became apparent, however,that Cézanne’s style and vision were clearlyunique.
While the Impressionists were concerned
with the effects of light on objects, Cézannewas more interested in showing the basic
form and structure of objects. He once said,
“Everything in nature is modeled after thesphere, the cone, and the cylinder. Onemust learn to paint from these simple fig-
ures.” Look at Figure 1–2. How did Cézanne
use these “simple figures” in his still life?
