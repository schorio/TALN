INTRODUCTION. 
many  passages,  and  even  some  whole  chapters,  appeal  to  us 
as  works  of  art,  and  we  feel  the  contagion  of  the  author's  hope, his  anxiety  to  serve  the  cause  of  truth  and  love,  his  indig 
nation  (sometimes  rather  sharply  expressed)  with  what 
blocks  the  path  of  advance,  and  his  contempt  for  much 
that  the  "cultured  crowd,"  in  our  erudite,  perverted  society, 
have  persuaded  themselves,  and  would  fain  persuade  others, 
is  the  highest  art. 
One  result  which  follows  inevitably  from  Tolstoy's  view 
(and  which  illustrates  how  widely  his  views  differ  from  the 
fashionable  aesthetic  mysticism),  is  that  art  is  not  stationary 
but  progressive.  It  is  true  that  our  highest  religious  per 
ception  found  expression  eighteen  hundred  years  ago,  and 
then  served  as  the  basis  of  an  art  which  is  still  un 
matched;  and  similar  cases  can  be  instanced  from  the 
East.  But  allowing  for  such  great  exceptions, — to  which, 
not  inaptly,  the  term  of  "  inspiration  "  has  been  specially 
applied,— the  subject-matter  of  art  improves,  though  long 
periods  of  time  may  have  to  be  considered  in  order  to 
make  this  obvious.  Our  power  of  verbal  expression,  for 
instance,  may  now  be  no  better  than  it  was  in  the  days  of 
David,  but  we  must  no  longer  esteem  as  good  in  subject- 
matter  poems  which  appeal  to  the  Eternal  to  destroy  a 
man's  private  or  national  foes ;  for  we  have  reached  a 
"religious  perception"  which  bids  us  have  no  foes,  and 
the  ultimate  source  (undefinable  by  us)  from  which  this 
consciousness  has  come,  is  what  we  mean  when  we  speak 
of  God.
