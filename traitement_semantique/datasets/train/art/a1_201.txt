Take Another Look
1.Look again at Figure 10–4. Escher used
the Penrose triangle three times in thisartwork. Can you locate them?
2.Add the sum of the three right angles in
Figure 10–5. How is this number differentfrom the sum of the angles in a real triangle?

IMPOSSIBLE FORMS
Escher came up with the idea for this
impossible structure after viewing the form shownin Figure 10–5. This object was created by a
British mathematician named Roger Penrose. Itlooks at first like an ordinary triangle. Lookcarefully, however, and you will notice that thistriangle has three right angles.Y ou may recalllearning the following two geometry facts:
●A right angle has 90 degrees.
●The sum of the angles in a triangle equals 180
degrees.
Here lies the mystery—and impossibility—of
Escher’s unusual water wheel. It is an impossiblestructure because it is based on an impossibleobject./rhombus6Figure 10–5 The Penrose triangle.
