138  WHAT  IS  ART? 
Listening  to  this  opera,  I  involuntarily  thought  of  a 
respected,  wise,  educated  country  labourer,  —  one,  for 
instance,  of  those  wise  and  truly  religious  men  whom  I 
know  among  the  peasants, — and  I  pictured  to  myself  the 
terrible  perplexity  such  a  man  would  be  in  were  he  to 
witness  what  I  was  seeing  that  evening. 
What  would  he  think  if  he  knew  of  all  the  labour  spent 
on  such  a  performance,  and  saw  that  audience,  those  great 
ones  of  the  earth, — old,  bald-headed,  grey-bearded  men, 
whom  he  had  been  accustomed  to  respect, — sit  silent  and 
attentive,  listening  to  and  looking  at  all  these  stupidities  for 
five  hours  on  end  1  Not  to  speak  of  an  adult  labourer,  one 
can  hardly  imagine  even  a  child  of  over  seven  occupying 
himself  with  such  a  stupid,  incoherent  fairy  tale. 
And  yet  an  enormous  audience,  the  cream  of  the  cultured 
upper  classes,  sits  out  five  hours  of  this  insane  performance, 
and  goes  away  imagining  that  by  paying  tribute  to  this 
nonsense  it  has  acquired  a  fresh  right  to  esteem  itself 
advanced  and  enlightened. 
I  speak  of  the  Moscow  public.  But  what  is  the  Moscow 
public  1  It  is  but  a  hundredth  part  of  that  public  which, 
while  considering  itself  most  highly  enlightened,  esteems  it 
a  merit  to  have  so  lost  the  capacity  of  being  infected  by  art, 
that  not  only  can  it  witness  this  stupid  sham  without  being 
revolted,  but  can  even  take  delight  in  it. 
In  Eayreuth,  where  these  performances  were  first  given, 
people  who  consider  themselves  finely  cultured  assembled 
from  the  ends  of  the  earth,  spent,  say  £100  each,  to  see 
this  performance,  and  for  four  days  running  they  went  to 
see  and  hear  this  nonsensical  rubbish,  sitting  it  out  for  six 
hours  each  day. 
But  why  did  people  go,  and  why  do  they  still  go  to  these 
performances,  and  why  do  they  admire  them  ?  The  question 
naturally  presents  itself :  How  is  the  success  of  Wagner's works  to  be  explained  ?
