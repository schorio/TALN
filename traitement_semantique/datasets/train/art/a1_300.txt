a Plaster Relief
One of the easiest ways to make
a plaster relief is with a claymold. When making a claymold, remember the following:•Plaster poured into the mold
will come out with theopposite image. Designdetails cut into the mold willappear raised on the relief.Details built up within themold will appear indented inthe relief.
•Do not make impressions in
your mold that have undercuts
(Figure T–14). Undercuts trapplaster, which will break offwhen the relief is removed.When cutting impressions,keep the deepest parts thenarrowest.
•In carving a raised area in 
the mold, take care not tocreate a reverse undercut(Figure T–15).
If you want to change the mold,simply smooth the area withyour fingers.19. Mixing Plaster
