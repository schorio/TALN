178  WHAT  IS  ART? 
The  second  consequence  is  that  the  productions  of  amuse- 
nient-art,  which  are  prepared  in  such  terrific  quantities  by 
the  armies  of  professional  artists,  enable  the  rich  people  of 
our  times  to  live  the  lives  they  do,  lives  not  only  unnatural 
but  in  contradiction  to  the  humane  principles  these  people 
themselves  profess.  To  live  as  do  the  rich,  idle  people, 
especially  the  women,  far  from  nature  and  from  animals, 
in  artificial  conditions,  with  muscles  atrophied  or  inis- 
developed  by  gymnastics,  and  with  enfeebled  vital  energy 
would  be  impossible  were  it  not  for  what  is  called  art â€” 
for  this  occupation  and  amusement  which  hides  from  them 
the  meaninglessness  of  their  lives,  and  saves  them  from 
the  dulness  that  oppresses  them.  Take  from  all  these 
people  the  theatres,  concerts,  exhibitions,  piano  -  playing, 
songs,  and  novels,  with  which  they  now  fill  their  time 
in  full  confidence  that  occupation  with  these  things  is 
a  very  refined,  sesthetical,  and  therefore  good  occupation; 
take  from  the  patrons  of  art  who  buy  pictures,  assist 
musicians,  and  are  acquainted  with  writers,  their  role  of 
protectors  of  that  important  matter  art,  and  they  will 
not  be  able  to  continue  such  a  life,  but  will  all  be  eaten 
up  by  ennui  and  spleen,  and  will  become  conscious  of 
the  meaninglessness  and  wrongness  of  their  present  mode 
of  life.  Only  occupation  with  what,  among  them,  is  con 
sidered  art,  renders  it  possible  for  them  to  continue  to 
live  on,  infringing  all  natural  conditions,  without  per 
ceiving  the  emptiness  and  cruelty  of  their  lives.  And  this 
support  afforded  to  the  false  manner  of  life  pursued  by 
the  rich  is  the  second  consequence,  and  a  serious  one,  of 
the  perversion  of  art. 
The  third  consequence  of  the  perversion  of  art  is  the 
perplexity  produced  in  the  minds  of  children  and  of  plain 
folk. .  Among  people  not  perverted  by  the  false  theories 
of  our  society,  among  workers  and  children,  there  exists  a 
very  definite  conception  of  what  people  may  be  respected
