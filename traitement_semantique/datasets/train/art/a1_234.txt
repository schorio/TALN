An early photographer comes up with
the first motion picture.
single event in 1872
helped pave the way
for the invention of motionpictures. Leland Stanford,a tycoon and former gov-ernor of California, hiredBritish-born EadweardMuybridge to photographStanford’s prized race-horse. The event ended upsettling a bet, proving thatthere was a moment whena galloping horse had allfour hooves off the groundat the same time.
That assignment
spurred Muybridge’sinterest in photographingmoving objects. For his next challenge, he lined up12 cameras along the sides of a racetrack. He attachedto each camera shutter a string that stretched acrossthe track. As the horses galloped by, each cameracaught the next split second of motion. Muybridgeran his still photos through a machine that flipped thephotos one by one in order. This may have been thefirst “moving” picture!
Muybridge photo-
