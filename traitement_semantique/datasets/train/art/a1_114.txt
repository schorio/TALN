A Renaissance masterpiece looks new again.
magine working on one project for nearly
ten years. That’s how long it took for a team
of expert art restorers to bring Renaissancemaster Michelangelo’s (1475–1564) famedSistine Chapel back to its original beauty. TheItalian art restorer Gianluigi Colalucci startedsmall, applying a new solvent to a postage-stamp-sized section of one of Michelangelo’sfrescoes. Colalucci’s work ended in 1989 withthe careful cleaning of one of Jonah’s toes. Thetoe turned from a gray smudge to a healthypink. The restorers took twice as long to cleanthe artwork as it did for the artist to paint it. 
Michelangelo began filling Rome’s Sistine Chapel
with stories and figures from the Bible in 1508, but hisgemlike colors didn’t last.They quickly dulled fromair pollution, dirt, and soot.In the late 1700s, an archaeolo-gist called Michelangelo“the weakest colorist.”However, the currentrestoration of Michelangelo’s
initial sparkling colorremoves any doubt about
his supreme skill.
