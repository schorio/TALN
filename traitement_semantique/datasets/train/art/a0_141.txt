98  WHAT  IS  ART? 
The  same  is  occurring  in  a  domain  in  which  it  seemed  hard 
to  be  unintelligible — in  the  sphere  of  novels  and  short  stories. 
Read  La  -  Bas  by  Huysmans,  or  some  of  Kipling's 
short  stories,  or  L'annonciateur  by  Villiers  de  1'Isle  Adam 
in  his  Contes  Gruels,  etc.,  and  you  will  find  them  not  only 
"  abscons  "  (to  use  a  word  adopted  by  the  neAv  writers),  but 
absolutely  unintelligible  both  in  form  and  in  substance. 
Such,  again,  is  the  work  by  E.  Morel,  Terre  Promise,  now 
appearing  in  the  Revue  Blanche,  and  such  are  most  of 
the  new  novels.  The  style  is  very  high-flown,  the  feelings 
seem  to  be  most  elevated,  but  you  can't  make  out  what  is 
happening,  to  whom  it  is  happening,  and  where  it  is  happen 
ing.  And  such  is  the  bulk  of  the  young  art  of  our  time. 
People  who  grew  up  in  the  first  half  of  this  century, 
admiring  Goethe,  Schiller,  Musset,  Hugo,  Dickens, 
Beethoven,  Chopin,  Raphael,  da  Vinci,  Michael  Angelo, 
Deiaroche,  being  unable  to  make  head  or  tail  of  this  new 
art,  simply  attribute  its  productions  to  tasteless  insanity  and 
wish  to  ignore  them.  But  such  an  attitude  towards  this 
new  art  is  quite  unjustifiable,  because,  in  the  first  place, 
that  art  is  spreading  more  and  more,  and  has  already 
conquered  for  itself  a  firm  position  in  society,  similar  to 
the  one  occupied  by  the  Romanticists  in  the  third  decade 
of  this  century ;  and  secondly  and  chiefly,  because,  if  it  is 
permissible  to  judge  in  this  way  of  the  productions  of  the 
latest  form  of  art,  called  by  us  Decadent  art,  merely  because 
we  do  not  understand  it,  then  remember,  there  are  an 
enormous  number  of  people, — all  the  labourers  and  many  of 
the  non-labouring  folk, — who,  in  just  the  same  way,  do  not 
comprehend  those  productions  of  art  which  we  consider 
admirable :  the  verses  of  our  favourite  artists — Goethe, 
Schiller,  and  Hugo;  the  novels  of  Dickens,  the  music  of 
Beethoven  and  Chopin,  the  pictures  of  Raphael,  Michael 
Angelo,  da  Vinci,  etc. 
If  I  have  a  right  to  think  that  great  masses  of  people  do
