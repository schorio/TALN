26 Chapter 2 The Principles of ArtHave you ever tried to learn another lan-
guage? To do so, you need to know morethan vocabulary. You also need to know therules of grammar. These rules govern how
words go together.
The language of art has its own set of rules.
These rules are called principles of art. They

the elements of art. In all there are eight such
principles. They are: balance, variety, harmony,emphasis, proportion, movement, rhythm,and pattern. In this lesson, you will meet thefirst of these principles, balance.
THEPRINCIPLE OF BALANCE
You have probably lost your balance at
one time or another. Maybe it was when youwere riding your bicycle.
In art, as in life, balance is important. To
an artist, balance is a principle of art concernedwith arranging the elements so that no one part 
of the work overpowers, or seems heavier than,any other part. Artists speak of three types of
balance:
●Formal balance . In art that has formal
balance, one half of a work is a mirrorimage of the other half. Formal balancecan give a feeling of dignity to a work ofart. Notice the decorated screen in Figure
2–2. With your finger, trace a vertical line
that divides the work in half and com-pare the two halves. Notice how they arealike. Can you find other examples offormal balance within this same work?
●Informal balance . Imagine yourself on a
seesaw with a much heavier person. Tobalance the two sides, you might ask theheavier person to move closer to thecenter. In art, the problem of balance issolved through the use of color and other
