WHAT  IS  ART?  39 
So  there  are  (and  it  could  not  be  otherwise)  only  two 
definitions  of  beauty :  the  one  objective,  mystical,  merging 
this  conception  into  that  of  the  highest  perfection,  God â€” a 
fantastic  definition,  founded  on  nothing ;  the  other,  on  the 
contrary,  a  very  simple  and  intelligible  subjective  one, 
which  considers  beauty  to  be  that  which  pleases  (I  do  not 
add  to  the  word  "  pleases  "  the  words  "  without  the  aim  of 
advantage,"  because  "pleases"  naturally  presupposes  the 
absence  of  the  idea  of  profit). 
On  the  one  hand,  beauty  is  viewed  as  something  mystical 
and  very  elevated,  but  unfortunately  at  the  same  time  very 
indefinite,  and  consequently  embracing  philosophy,  religion, 
and  life  itself  (as  in  the  theories  of  Schelling  and  Hegel, 
and  their  German  and  French  followers) ;  or,  on  the  other 
hand  (as  necessarily  follows  from  the  definition  of  Kant  and 
his  adherents),  beauty  is  simply  a  certain  kind  of  disinterested 
pleasure  received  by  us.  And  this  conception  of  beauty, 
although  it  seems  very  clear,  is,  unfortunately,  again  inexact ; 
for  it  widens  out  on  the  other  side,  i.e.  it  includes  the 
pleasure  derived  from  drink,  from  food,  from  touching  a 
delicate  skin,  etc.,  as  is  acknowledged  by  Guyau,  Kralik, 
and  others. 
It  is  true  that,  following  the  development  of  the  aesthetic 
doctrines  on  beauty,  we  may  notice  that,  though  at  first  (in 
the  times  when  the  foundations  of  the  science  of  aesthetics 
were  being  laid)  the  metaphysical  definition  of  beauty 
prevailed,  yet  the  nearer  we  get  to  our  own  times  the 
more  does  an  experimental  definition  (recently  assuming  a 
physiological  form)  come  to  the  front,  so  that  at  last  we 
even  meet  with  such  sestheticians  as  Veron  and  Sully,  who  try 
to  escape  entirely  from  the  conception  of  beauty.  But  such 
aestheticians  have  very  little  success,  and  with  the  majority  of 
the  public,  as  well  as  of  artists  and  the  learned,  a  conception 
of  beauty  is  firmly  held  which  agrees  with  the  definitions 
contained  in  most  of  the  aesthetic  treatises,  i.e.  which  regards
