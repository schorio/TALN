these three are mixed to create all the other
hues. Mixing the two primary colors of yel-low and blue gives green, a secondary color.
Mixing a primary color like red with a sec-ondary color like orange gives red-orange, anintermediate color. Look at the painting in Fig-
ure 1–10. The artist has overlapped hues to
capture all the colors of the rainbow. Matchthe hues in the painting with those on thecolor wheel. Has the artist used any primaryhues? Which secondary hues has she used?Which intermediate hues has she used?Value
The art element, value, is the lightness or
darkness of a hue. Value is also considered as a
property of color. You can change a hue’svalue by mixing in white or black. Whenwhite is added to a hue, the resulting color is said to be a tint. When black is added, the
resu lt is called a shade. Pink is a tint of red.
Maroon is a dark shade of red. These andother values of red appear in the value scalein Figure 1–11a.
