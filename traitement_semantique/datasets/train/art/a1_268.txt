President Woodrow Wilson wanted to avoid in-
volving the United States in the war. Most Americanswanted it that way, too. They elected the presidentto a second term based mainly on his campaign slogan. That slogan read simply, “He Kept Us Out of War.”
Events that soon followed forced Wilson’s hand,
however. Chief among these was the sinking of theluxury liner Lusitania. All on board died, including128 Americans. A German submarine claimed re-sponsibility for the disaster.
Wilson had seen enough. On April 2, 1917, he
spoke before a joint session of Congress. He askedCongress to declare war on Germany. Doing so, hesaid, would keep the world “safe for democracy.”The United States would join forces with two otherdemocratic nations. These were Great Britain andFrance. 
Ap a t riotic whirlwind immediately swept the
country. Young American males rushed to enlist.
