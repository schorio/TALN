you can read.
aith Ringgold makes it easy to fall
asleep while reading a story. Her fabric
quilts have tales and stories right on them.However, Ringgold’s quilts are not justblankets. They are works of art.
For centuries, the realm of fine arts 
was limited to painting and sculpture.Items such as quilts made for the homeweren’t thought of as art. At best, theyqualified as a craft.
No one disputes that Ringgold’s
fabrics are art. As a child, she learnedabout fabric from her mother, a clothingdesigner in New York City’s Harlem—amostly African American neighborhood.In her mother’s shop, Ringgold heardcustomers tell stories, which would laterfind their way into her work. Ringgoldmade her first story quilt with her mother.The quilt had 30 painted fabric grids. Eachgrid had a portrait of a Harlem resident. Sincethen, Ringgold has continued painting, printing,and writing stories on quilts. She combineshistorical and fictional characters to create talesabout fascinating African American women.
