xxvi  INTRODUCTION.

This  is  the  foundation  on  which  the  whole  work  is  based. 
It  follows  necessarily  from  this  perception  that  we  should 
consider  as  most  important  in  science  "investigations  into 
the  results  of  good  and  bad  actions,  considerations  of  the 
reasonableness  or  unreasonableness  of  human  institutions 
and  beliefs,  considerations  of  how  human  life  should  be 
lived  in  order  to  obtain  the  greatest  well-being  for  each;  as 
to  what  one  may  and  ought,  and  what  one  cannot  and 
should  not  believe;  how  to  subdue  one's  passions,  and  how 
to  acquire  the  habit  of  virtue."  This  is  the  science  that 
"  occupied  Moses,  Solon,  Socrates,  Epictetus,  Confucius, 
Mencius,  Marcus  Aurelius,  Spinoza,  and  all  those  who  have 
taught  men  to  live  a  moral  life,"  and  it  is  precisely  the  kind of  scientific  investigation  to  which  Tolstoy  has  devoted  most 
of  the  last  twenty  years,  and  for  the  sake  of  which  he  is 
often  said  to  have  "  abandoned  art." 
Since  science,  like  art,  is  a  "  human  activity,"  that  science 
best  deserves  our  esteem,  best  deserves  to  be  "chosen, 
tolerated,  approved,  and  diffused,"  which  treats  of  what  is 
supremely  important  to  man ;  which  deals  with  urgent, 
vital,  inevitable  problems  of  actual  life.  Such  science  as 
this  brings  "to  the  consciousness  of  men  the  truths  that 
flow  from  the  religious  perception  of  our  times,"  and 
"indicates  the  various  methods  of  applying  this  conscious 
ness  to  life."  "Art  should  transform  this  perception  into 
feeling." 
The  "  science  "  which  is  occupied  in  "pouring  liquids 
from  one  jar  into  another,  or  analysing  the  spectrum,  or 
cutting  up  frogs  and  porpoises,"  is  no  use  for  rendering  such 
guidance  to  art,  though  capable  of  practical  applications 
which,  under  a  more  righteous  system  of  society,  might 
greatly  have  lightened  the  sufferings  of  mankind. 
Naturally  enough,  the  last  chapter  of  the  book  deals  with 
the  relation  between  science  and  art.  And  the  conclusion 
is  that :
