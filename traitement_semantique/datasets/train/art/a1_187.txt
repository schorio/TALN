is not true of modern urban centers such as
New York, London, and Tokyo. In the lasthundred years, these overcrowded cities havehad only one direction in which to go. Thatdirection is up.
The solution to the problem of limited
space was solved toward the close of the1800s. The person credited with the solutionwas a pioneering Chicago architect. His namewas Louis H. Sullivan. Sullivan hit upon theidea of a steel frame made of crisscrossingbeams. To this day, Sullivan’s steel “skeleton”is at the heart of every skyscraper. An exam-ple of this modern architectural wonder appears in Figure 9–12. What steps has the
architect taken to make this structure lessboxlike than other skyscrapers you may haveseen?
