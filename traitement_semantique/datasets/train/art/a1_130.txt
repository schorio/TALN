116 Chapter 6 Perceiving Nature“March comes in like a lion and goes out
like a lamb.” You have probably heard thissaying. It describes two of nature’s personal-ities. The second of them is nature’s gentleside. This can be seen on a mild spring daywhen there is sunshine, a soft breeze, and theseason’s first flowers. 
The first—nature’s rough and sometimes
frightening side—is another personality. Withfloods, earthquakes, and tornadoes, we ex-perience the power of nature. In this lesson,you will see and learn about artworks that relate to nature’s power.CAPTURING A STORM IN A PAINTING
Sometimes nature’s fury makes the head-
lines. The threat of a hurricane sends coastalresidents packing. A blizzard dumping three
feet of snow closes schools for days.
Weather conditions command the atten-
tion of the news media and artists. The paint-ing in Figure 6–14 shows the raw power of
nature. Look closely at this work. You can al-most feel the force of the wind that tears atthe struggling tree in the foreground. You canalmost hear the sound of the foaming wavescrashing against the rocks.
