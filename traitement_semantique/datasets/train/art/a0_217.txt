174  WHAT  IS  ART'* 
not  unite  all  men,  but  unites  only  a  few,  dividing  them  of! 
from  the  rest  of  mankind. 
And,  just  in  this  same  way,  in  all  branches  of  art,  many 
and  many  works  considered  great  by  the  upper  classes  of  our 
society  will  have  to  be  judged.  By  this  one  sure  criterion 
we  shall  have  to  judge  the  celebrated  Divine  Comedy  and 
Jerusalem  Delivered,  and  a  great  part  of  Shakespeare's  and 
Goethe's  works,  and  in  painting  every  representation  of 
miracles,  including  Raphael's  "  Transfiguration,"  etc. 
Whatever  the  work  may  be  and  however  it  may  have 
been  extolled,  we  have  first  to  ask  whether  this  work  is  one 
of  real  art  or  a  counterfeit.  Having  acknowledged,  on  the 
basis  of  the  indication  of  its  infectiousness  even  to  a  small 
class  of  people,  that  a  certain  production  belongs  to  the 
realm  of  art,  it  is  necessary,  on  the  basis  of  the  indication 
of  its  accessibility,  to  decide  the  next  question,  Does  this 
work  belong  to  the  category  of  bad,  exclusive  art,  opposed 
to  religious  perception,  or  to  Christian  art,  uniting  people! 
And  having  acknowledged  an  article  to  belong  to  real 
Christian  art,  we  must  then,  according  to  whether  it 
transmits  the  feelings  flowing  from  love  to  God  and  man, 
or  merely  the  simple  feelings  uniting  all  men,  assign  it  a 
place  in  the  ranks  of  religious  art  or  in  those  of  universal  art. 
Only  on  the  basis  of  such  verification  shall  we  find  it 
possible  to  select  from  the  whole  mass  of  what,  in  our 
;  society,  claims  to  be  art,  those  works  which  form  real, 
\  important,  necessary  spiritual  food,  and  to  separate  them 
from  all  the  harmful  and  useless  art,  and  from  the  counter 
feits  of  art  which  surround  us.  Only  on  the  basis  of  such 
verification  shall  we  be  able  to  rid  ourselves  of  the  pernicious 
results  of  harmful  art,  and  to  avail  ourselves  of  that  bene 
ficent  action  which  is  the  purpose  of  true  and  good  art,  and 
which  is  indispensable  for  the  spiritual  life  of  man  and  of 
humanity.
