of the picture is given over to a sweeping
curve of wind and snow. Can you find thepeople in this picture? Their tiny forms, alongwith that of a small animal, appear huddledin the lower-right corner. The artist achievesunity in this work in the following ways. He:
●uses proportion to contrast the vast fury 
of the storm with the small people. 
●captures vivid movement through the
careful use of line and color. 
●adds excitement and suspense throughinformal balance.
●draws the viewer’s eye from one part of
the work to another through variety in
shape, form, and color.
In most cases, the art elements and art
principles are interdependent. Interdependent
means being dependent on one another. Forexample, the art principle of movement is dependent on the element of line to create asense of motion.
Recognizing Unity
One way of recognizing unity in an art-
work is by using a checklist like the one inFigure 2–15. For each element used, you
would make a check mark in the box underthe principles the artist has used to organizeeach element.

checklist in Figure 2–15 onto a blanksheet of paper. Look back at Figure 2–8on page 32. Go through the checklistone element at a time. For each elementfound, identify the principle or principles
used. Remember that not all artworksuse all elements and principles.
