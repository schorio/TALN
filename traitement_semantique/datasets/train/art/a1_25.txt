Complementary
As its name suggests, the complementary
color scheme ( Figure 1–11e ) uses opposite
hues on the color wheel. It makes for the moststriking color combinations. As with mono-chromatic colors, care must be taken whencombining complementary colors. Placinghigh-intensity complementary colors close to-gether in an artwork can create an unusualflickering effect.

Experimenting with 
Color Combinations
Practical applications. Gather sheets of
colored cellophane. Cut circles or othershapes from each sheet. Experimentwith different color combinations byoverlapping the shapes in a clear plastic
folder. Secure the edges of the f older.
Then hold it up to the light. In yoursketchbook, note combinations that areespecially pleasing to your eye. Repeatthe experiment, this time overlappingmore colors. Try more than one layer ofa single color to deepen it. Last, trymaking combinations of warm colors —
red, yellow, and orange—and of cool
colors —blue, green, and violet. Think
about scenes in which you might belikely to use a warm color scheme. Howmight you use a cool color scheme?
