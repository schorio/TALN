CHAPTER  IX 
THE  unbelief  of  the  upper  classes  of  the  European  world 
had  this  effect,  that  instead  of  an  artistic  activity  aiming  at 
transmitting  the  highest  feelings  to  which  humanity  has 
attained, — those  flowing  from  religious  perception, — we  have 
an  activity  which  aims  at  affording  the  greatest  enjoyment 
to  a  certain  class  of  society.  And  of  all  the  immense  domain  ' 
of  art,  that  part  has  been  fenced  off,  and  is  alone  called  art, 
which  affords  enjoyment  to  the  people  of  this  particular 
circle. 
Apart  from  the  moral  effects  on  European  society  of  such 
a  selection  from  the  whole  sphere  of  art  of  what  did  not  de 
serve  such  a  valuation,  and  the  acknowledgment  of  it  as 
important  art,  this  perversion  of  art  has  weakened  art  itself, 
and  well-nigh  destroyed  it.  The  first  great  result  was  that 
art  was  deprived  of  the  infinite,  varied,  and  profound  religious 
subject-matter  proper  to  it.  The  second  result  was  that 
having  only  a  small  circle  of  people  in  view,  it  lost  its  beauty 
of  form  and  became  affected  and  obscure  ;  and  the  third  and 
chief  result  was  that  it  ceased  to  be  either  natural  or  even 
sincere,  and  became  thoroughly  artificial  and  brain-spun. 
The  first  result — the  impoverishment  of  subject-matter — 
followed  because  only  that  is  a  true  work  of  art  which  v 
transmits  fresh  feelings  not  before  experienced  by  man. 
As  thought-product  is  only  then  real  thought-product  when 
it  transmits  new  conceptions  and  thoughts,  and  does  not 
merely  repeat  what  was  known  before,  so  also  an  art- 
product  is  only  then  a  genuine  art-product  when  it  brings
