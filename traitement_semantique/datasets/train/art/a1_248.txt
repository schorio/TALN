“Her words paint a vivid picture.” “His painting tells a
dramatic story.”Y ou have probably read descriptions like these.
The first sentence describes a skillful writer, and the second
describes a skillful artist. Sentences like these illustrate the
tight bond that connects literature and art. These two forms of
expression are so related that sometimes they overlap. In fact,
many artworks are based on or inspired by literature.
INTERPRETING LITERATURE
The passage in Figure 12–12 is from Washington
Irving’s The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. In this scene,
Ichabod Crane and his horse Gunpowder are
being pursued by the dreaded Headless
Horseman. Read Irving’s excerpt. Pay close
“If I can but reach that bridge,” thought
Ichabod, “I am safe.” Just then he heard the
black steed panting and blowing close be-
hind him; he even fancied that he felt his hot
breath. Another convulsive kick in the ribs,
and old Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge;
he thundered over the resounding planks . . .
Ichabod cast a look behind . . . Just then he saw
the goblin rising in his stirrups, and in the very
act of hurling his head at him. Ichabod en-
deavored to dodge the horrible missile, but
too late. It encountered his cranium with a
tremendous crash—he was tumbled head-
long into the dust, and Gunpowder, the
black steed, and the goblin rider, passed by
like a whirlwind.”
