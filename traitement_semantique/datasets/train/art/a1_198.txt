184 Chapter 10 Examining ObjectsArtists have a special way of looking at
things. They look at the ordinary and see theextraordinary. They look at a rain-slicked fencein the countryside and see a study in color andform and texture. They look at a battered oldshoe and see a wholeness—a unity—that goesbeyond the scuffed leather and tattered laces. 
Some artists are born with this ability to
“see.” Others are trained to perceive —to 
become aware through the senses of the special na-ture of objects. In this chapter, you will share
several artists’ one-of-a-kind visions of ob-jects in the world around them. You will alsosharpen your ability to perceive.NATURE STUDIES
“Stop and smell the roses.” Are you fa-
miliar with this saying? It underscores theidea that there is much that is beautiful andexciting in nature, if only we take the time tonotice it. 
Artists have been seeking out and per-
ceiving the beauty in nature throughout theages. The works on these pages are the resultof two stops to “smell the roses.” The paint-ings were made at different times and in dif-ferent places. Yet, a common link existsbetween them. Both record objects found innature.
