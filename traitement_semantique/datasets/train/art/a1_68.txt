54 Chapter 3 Art Media and TechniquesArtists are always on the lookout for new
ways of creating. One such way is shown inFigure 3–16. This work is a collage (kuh-
lahzh ). Based on a French word meaning “to
glue,” a collage is an artwork arranged from
cut or torn materials that are pasted to a sur-face. The group of artists who came up withthis idea lived and worked in the early 1900s. 
Study Figure 3–16. The work contains a
rich assortment of objects and materials.These include photographs of African masksand one of a cat. What other familiar imagescan you find? Notice how the artist used rec-tangular patches of colored paper to create a window.
