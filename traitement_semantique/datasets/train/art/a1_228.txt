In leading many Black slaves out
of bondage, Tubman encouraged
crowds of slaves to follow her on
faith, hastening across unfamiliar
territories to freedom. The
darkness of the night protected
them and their numbers
sustained these fleeing bands of
men and women. The lesson of
sustenance from group action is
realized in subsequent images.Excerpt from

Artists, as you have seen, can function as historians and
storytellers. Few have enjoyed more success in both areas
than twentieth-century African American artist Jacob
Lawrence. Early in his career, Lawrence created several
narrative art series based on historical figures.
The most inspirational of these was his 1939 series The
Life of Harriet Tubman. Harriet Tubman herself, of course,
is an inspiring figure in American history. Born into
slavery, she escaped to freedom through the now-
famous Underground Railroad. She then
returned to the South, endangering her life to
rescue countless other enslaved African
Americans. Lawrence wrote the narrative
in Figure 11–12 for hi s work on the
Harriet Tubman series.LESSON 6LESSON 6 ArtSocial
