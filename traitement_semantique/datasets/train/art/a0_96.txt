CHAPTER  VI 
Bur  how  could  it  happen  that  that  very  art,  which  in 
ancient  times  was  merely  tolerated  (if  tolerated  at  all), 
should  have  come,  in  our  times,  to  be  invariably  considered 
a  good  thing  if  only  it  affords  pleasure  1 
It  has  resulted  from  the  following  causes.  The  estimation 
of  the  value  of  art  (i.e.  of  the  feelings  it  transmits)  depends 
on  men's  perception  of  the  meaning  of  life ;  depends  on 
what  they  consider  to  be  the  good  and  the  evil  of  life. 
And  what  is  good  and  what  is  evil  is  denned  by  what  are 
termed  religions. 
Humanity  unceasingly  moves  forward  from  a  lower,  more 
partial,  and  obscure  understanding  of  life,  to  one  more 
general  and  more  lucid.  And  in  this,  as  in  every  movement, 
there  are  leaders, — those  who  have  understood  the  meaning 
of  life  more  clearly  than  others, — and  of  these  advanced  men 
there  is  always  one  who  has,  in  his  words  and  by  his  life, 
expressed  this  meaning  more  clearly,  accessibly,  and  strongly 
than  others.  This  man's  expression  of  the  meaning  of  life, 
together  with  those  superstitions,  traditions,  and  ceremonies 
which  usually  form  themselves  round  the  memory  of  such  a 
man,  is  what  is  called  a  religion.  Religions  are  the  ex 
ponents  of  the  highest  comprehension  of  life  accessible  to 
the  best  and  foremost  men  at  a  given  time  in  a  given  society  ; 
a  comprehension  towards  which,  inevitably  and  irresistibly, 
all  the  rest  of  that  society  must  advance.  And  therefore 
only  religions  have  always  served,  and  still  serve,  as  bases 
for  the  valuation  of  human  sentiments.  If  feelings  bring 53  ,
