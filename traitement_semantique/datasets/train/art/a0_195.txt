ART,  in  our  society,  has  been  so  perverted  that  not  only  has 
bad  art  come  to  be  considered  good,  but  even  the  very  per 
ception  of  what  art  really  is  has  been  lost.  In  ordejr  tq  be 
able  to  speak  about  the  art  of  our  society,  it  is,  therefore, 
first  of  all  necessary  to  distinguish  art  from  counterfeit  art. 
There  is  one  indubitable  indication  distinguishing  real 
art  from  its  counterfeit,  namely,  the  infectiousness  of  art. 
If  a  man,  without  exercising  effort  and  without  altering  his 
istandpoint,  on  reading,  hearing,  or  seeing  another  man's 
(work,  experiences  a  mental  condition  which  unites  him 
[with  that  man  and  with  other  people  who  also  partake  of 
that  work  of  art,  then  the  object  evoking  that  condition  is 
a  work  of  art.  And  however  poetical,  realistic,  effectful,  or 
interesting  a  work  may  be,  it  is  not  a  work  of  art  if  it  does 
not  evoke  that  feeling  (quite  distinct  from  all  other  feelings) 
of  joy,  and  of  spiritual  union  with  another  (the  author)  and 
with  others  (those  who  are  also  infected  by  it). 
It  is  true  that  this  indication  is  an  internal  one,  and  that 
there  are  people  who  have  forgotten  what  the  action  of  real 
art  is,  who  expect  something  else  from  art  (in  our  society 
the  great  majority  are  in  this  state),  and  that  therefore  such 
people  may  mistake  for  this  aesthetic  feeling  the  feeling  of 
divertisement  and  a  certain  excitement  which  they  receive 
from  counterfeits  of  art.  But  though  it  is  impossible  to 
undeceive  these  people,  just  as  it  is  impossible  to  convince 
a  man  suffering  from  "Daltonism"  that  green  is  not  red, 
yet,  for  all  that,  this  indication  remains  perfectly  definite 152
