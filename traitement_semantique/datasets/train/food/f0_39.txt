MEAL PLANNING
Meal planning is a process of determining, selecting and preparing 
foods to ensure a balanced diet for target groups or individ -
uals. People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumersâ€™ characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning.
Common terms used in meal planning
A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. 
The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults.
A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts 
of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.
Variety means including different foods from different food groups and 
within each food group, for example consuming cereals, root tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava), meat, vegetables and variety of fruits.
A serving is a quantity of food suitable for or given to one person in 
one meal.
Moderation  means keeping servings reasonable. This involves self-
control and addresses the aspect of too much food intake that leads to 
becoming overweight and obese.
