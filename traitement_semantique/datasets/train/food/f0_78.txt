Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers67E) NUTRITION CONSIDERATION IN AGRICULTURAL 
MARKETING 
Marketing is key to agricultural production because without it there is 
no financial return on investment in agriculture. Marketing stimulates and sustains production. It is understandable when farmers seek to get 
market for their produce because it makes business sense. However 
marketing should not compromise household food security and nutri -
tion for the producer and consumer:
• Marketing should consider nutrition of the end user/consumer and 
thus packaging should be done in dry and clean packs/materials/
containers.
• For marketing to result in improved nutrition gender relations in the 
homes are very critical.
• Both men and women should participate in marketing of farm produce, but because gender relations are still complicated women 
could be allowed to be in charge of marketing traditional ‘low value’ 
crops.
• Women should also be allowed to have control and access of the incomes accrued from their participation in the marketing of foods.
• It is highly likely that women will use the incomes they have got from food sales to buy other nutritious foods for the whole house -
hold.
• Income from the sale of farm produce can be spent on a number of priority areas but food and dietary needs should not be compro-
mised.
KEY MESSAGE 
Agricultural marketing should ensure food and nutrition security 
for the producer and consumer. Gender relations are very critical in nutrition sensitive marketing.
