Malnutrition is one of the main public health and economic and devel -
opment problems facing Uganda. Children below the age of five years 
and women in reproductive age including pregnant women and lactating 
mothers are mostly affected (UDHS 2011). Children below the age of 5 years suffer mostly from under nutrition with:
• 33% of these children suffer from chronic undernutrition (they are 
stunted)
• 14% are underweight (body weight too light for their age)
• 49% suffer from iron deficiency anaemia (lack of iron/blood)
• 60% suffer from different forms of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) 
Likewise women in reproductive age (15 –49 years) also suffer from 
malnutrition:
• 52% of pregnant women and lactating mothers have vitamin A defi-
ciency
• 23% suffered from iron deficiency anaemia
