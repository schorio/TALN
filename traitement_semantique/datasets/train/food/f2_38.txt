There’s no wonder these little powerhouses star in lists of 
‘superfoods’, ‘the best foods’ and ‘the foods you should eat 
more of’. Their protein, vitamin E and good fat content, 
paired with desirable flavour and texture, remains 
unmatched. The crunch makes them a great addition to 
almost every dish. Yet, of the many varieties available, only 
a few are commonly eaten. Used in cuisines around the 
world, these small embryonic plants can stand alone as 
snacks or add flavour and a satisfying crunch to salads, 
soups and desserts.
