Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers83Annex	3.	Ways	of	Boosting	the	Nutritive	
Value of Porridge
How	to	further	boost	nutritive	value	or	food	value	of	porridge
• Add vegetable oil to porridge improve its energy value.
• Add eggs, milk to improve protein.
• Use of flour made out of sprouted and dried cereal grains like millet. 
The presence of amylase partially digests the complex and bulky 
carbohydrates and makes the porridge more energy dense.
• Add fruit juices like lemon, oranges, lime etc. just before serving 
porridge increases vitamin C value, palatability/ taste and enhances 
absorption of nutrients.
Porridge made from fermented cereals or legumes reduce incidence of 
diarrhoea during weaning. Addition of juice from fruits (ascorbic acid) to 
porridge greatly enhances absorption of minerals like iron and improves 
the taste. Such food preparation methods should be encouraged in the communities.
The advantages of sour and fermented porridge as a weaning food:
• It is more difficult for harmful bacteria to grow in. It keeps safely for 
2–3 days even in warm weather. It is therefore less likely to give a 
child diarrhoea than ordinary porridge.
• It is thinner and easier for a baby to eat and digest than plain por -
ridge.
• The absorption of non-haem iron, zinc and some other minerals is 
increased.
