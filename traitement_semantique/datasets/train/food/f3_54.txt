different sources of food information amongst EU citizens between 2010 and 2019.

While these response categories were not measured in the European Food Safety Barometer survey in 2010 (European Food Safety Authority, 2010), EU citizens also cite the trust that they have in non-governmental organisations (NGOs) (56 per cent), journalists (50 per cent) and influencers, celebrities and bloggers (19 per cent) in 2019 (European Food Safety Authority, 2019).
There are differences between the value 
that different consumers place on different information. High-income consumers, those willing to buy expensive products and consumers that are health conscious when making consumption and purchasing decisions are more likely to use packaging information (Ghvanidze et al., 2017; Palma et al., 2017). The type of label will also have different importance for consumers. Fat content labels are important for all consumers, origin labels and carbon footprint labels have a moderate impact across all consumer groups, while brand, point of purchase (i.e. labels enabling consumers to assess healthiness of foods) and production method labels are significantly but comparatively less important for consumer choices (Apostolidis & McLeay, 2019).
The review process did not come across 
academic evidence exploring the type of information that can change food practices. However, a European Food Safety Authority European-wide study cites that two-thirds of all European citizens have changed their consumption as a result of information on food risks (European Food Safety Authority, 2019). Evidence also exists that some consumers

should be taken with some caution as the question wording and response options differed in 2010 and 2019.  value information on nutritional quality more than information on the social responsibility of products and their ecological impact (Hodgkins et al., 2019; Omar et al., 2014).While information has some effect on consumersâ€™ food practices, it is difficult to isolate the effects of specific types of information and the extent to which consumers only state that they value particular types of information. The influence of information is also likely to depend on consumer beliefs and values, as well as factors in the wider food environment (Webb & Byrd-Bredbenner, 2015).
Although most consumers think 
that food in the UK is safe, food safety is a concern for some consumers when choosing food 
Consumers in the UK and in the rest of Europe 
cite that food safety is a concern when choosing food (Balcombe et al., 2010; European Food Safety Authority, 2019; FSA, 2019b; Jackson, 2010; Saltmarsh, 2014). For example, 41 per cent of UK respondents say that they are interested in food safety when choosing food (European Food Safety Authority, 2019) and 60 per cent of UK consumers say they look at the hygiene rating of food outlets when choosing where to consume food (FSA, 2019b). However, there is no uniform food safety concern that is prevalent in all countries and across all consumer groups. Areas of general food safety concern include: the presence of antibiotics, hormone or steroid residues in meat; pesticide residues in food; environmental pollutants in fish, meat or dairy; and additives such as colours, preservatives and flavourings that are used in food and drinks (European Food Safety Authority, 2019; FSA, 2019b; Jackson, 2010; Saltmarsh, 2014).
