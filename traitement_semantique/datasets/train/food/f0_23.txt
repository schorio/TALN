Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers12Minerals
Minerals are required for the normal functioning of body processes, 
including growth, development, water balance and neurological processes.
Minerals of public health importance
Iron is an essential component of blood and helps transfer oxygen to 
various body tissues. Dietary sources include red meat, fish, poultry 
(easily absorbed), legumes, leafy green vegetables (less easily absorbed, but absorption increases if eaten with animal source iron or vitamin C).
Calcium is a key component of bones and teeth and is needed for a strong 
skeleton and important in blood clotting. The major source of calcium in 
the world is milk and milk products. Other sources include fish eaten with bones (silver fish—mukene, haplochromis species—nkeje) and dark green vegetables (plant sources are not well absorbed).
Iodine is important for thyroid function and for mental development of 
children. The most important dietary source is iodized salt.
Zinc enhances and strengthens the immune system, helps wound 
healing, facilitates digestion and is an important component of skeletal 
muscle. Dietary sources include beef, seafood, liver, nuts, beans and whole grains.
Other minerals involved in various body functions are chromium, 
copper, fluoride, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, potas-
sium, phosphorus, sodium and selenium.
Mineral requirements
Minerals that are required by the body in relatively large amounts such 
as calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, chlorine, sodium and magnesium require deliberate efforts to be supplied them through increased food production, consumption and supplementation.
Most trace mineral elements such as iodine copper, manganese, fluo -
rine, cobalt, nickel, zinc, chromium and selenium are supplied by a wide 
variety of foods and the body is unlikely to be deficient in them when one consumes a balanced diet.
