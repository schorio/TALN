2) Micronutrients
These are required by the body in small amounts and include: vitamins and minerals.
Vitamins
Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func -
tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins:
a) Fat-soluble vitamins
These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed.
They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary 
for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot -
ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and 
absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins 
include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables.
b) Water-soluble vitamins
These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly.
They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their 
functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu -
trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol -
uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, 
meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals. Citrus fruits are an espe-
cially good source of vitamin C. Vitamin C is crucial for improving iron  
bioavailability from plant food sources.
