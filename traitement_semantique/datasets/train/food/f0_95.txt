Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers84• If necessary, increase the amount of food and the number of meals 
that the child eats.
• Increase the length of time between breast feeds, so that the num -
ber of breast feeds decreases gradually.
• Apart from those times when you decide to breastfeed, avoid situa -
tions that make the child think of breastfeeding for example, having 
the child on her lap if she sits down to eat or to have a drink.
• The child should be given extra loving attention, and the child-moth -
er bond should be strengthened.
• Do not push the child away from the breast when she/he tries to 
breast feed as this may make the child feel anxious and unhappy.
• The mother should stop the night breast feeds last of all.
• Supervise the care and feeding of the child at all times.
