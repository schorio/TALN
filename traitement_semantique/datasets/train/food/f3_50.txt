for the choice to consume organic products 
(Hashem et al., 2018). However, it is not just the presence of foods that drive food decisions but also the lack of alternatives (Jensen et al., 2011; Kamar et al., 2016; Paddock et al., 2017; Stephens et al., 2018; Vinther et al., 2016). For example consumers are more likely to choose meat options when there are no vegetarian options available (Vinther et al., 2016).
However, the availability and convenience of 
food in different food environments is not as dominant in shaping food consumption choices as cost. Instead, availability and convenience are associated and interplay with other factors such as advertising, the food culture (such as the ‘grab it and go’ food culture) and the consumption patterns of peers, portion sizes and price (Kamar et al., 2016; Roberto et al., 2015; Roe et al., 2016; Wills et al., 2019; Ziauddeen et al., 2018) .
The built and micro food 
environments have an influence on consumption
There is evidence from high-quality sources 
that the built food environment and the food architecture
23 influences where we buy and 
eat food24 and shapes individuals’ food-related 
decisions (Burgoine et al., n.d.; Horgan et al., 2019; Moore et al., 2010; Roberto et al., 2015; Tyrrell et al., 2017; Ziauddeen et al., 2018). Eating at home and at school or university is generally associated with healthier food choices than eating in food outlets, ‘on the go’ and at leisure places (Blow et al., 2019; Mak et al., 2012; Shareck et al., 2018; Tanton et al., 2015; Tyrrell et al., 2017; Ziauddeen et al., 2018). Children are more likely to consume fruit 
23 Food architecture is defined by Roberto et al as the placement of  food items in supermarkets, the price of products 
and the strategies used to promote foods (Roberto et al., 2015).
24 This includes both food prepared and consumed at home and out-of-home sources (Townshend & Lake, 2017)and vegetables in ‘structured and formal care settings’ (e.g. at school) rather than at home (Mak et al., 2012). However, this is contrasted with weaker evidence that eating at school has less of an impact on food-related practices than the consumption of fruits and vegetables at home (Tanton et al., 2015; Tyrrell et al., 2017). Similarly, the consumption of food in certain environments increases the likelihood of eating certain food products. For example, meat consumption was found to be more likely in a restaurant than when eating at home (Horgan et al., 2019). In one study, young adults stated being aware of how the physical environment shapes their food choices, stating awareness of techniques to make food more appealing, such as the placement of snack foods, displays in supermarkets and convenience stores (Howse et al., 2018).  However, although there is a growing evidence base on the influence of the built and micro environment on consumption, there is some mixed evidence (e.g. regarding the impact of structured and formal care settings on children’s fruit and vegetable consumption) and important gaps that require further investigation, such as the impact of socio-demographic differences in access to fast-food outlets and the impact of planning policies to restrict fast-food outlets near schools (Townshend & Lake, 2017). 
Food environments interact with other 
drivers in multiple ways. First, the influence of food environments depends on the social relationships and cultures that facilitate certain consumption patterns. Food environments are socially and  culturally embedded, and so the social relationships and cultures created in certain food outlets and when eating with friends are an important driver of food practices and consumption (Allman-Farinelli
