Wild rice 
Zizania 21
This so-called ‘rice’ isn’t a rice at all. Wild rice 
is the seed of a semi-aquatic grass that grows 
wild in North American lakes and rivers.  
Long and thin, the seeds are covered in green, 
brown or black husks. After harvesting, the husk 
is dried then hulled. Often mixed with brown 
and white rice, wild rice is not commercially 
grown and, therefore, supply is scarce in  
many parts of the world.
Deliciously nutty, toasty and earthy with a 
chewy texture, wild rice is easy to digest and 
is a source of a variety of valuable minerals. Compared with white rice, wild rice contains 
more protein, zinc and iron22, 34. Like rice,  
it is boiled in water or stock. It can also be 
popped like corn for a colourful and more 
nutritious version of popcorn, is great mixed 
with other grains, added to salads, soups and 
mixed with other grains and vegetables to 
make vegetarian burgers.
