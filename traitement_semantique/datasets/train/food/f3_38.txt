Consumption trends – what foods are 
people consuming, where and how?
Analysis of trends over the last ten years 
(2010–2019) indicates that although the foods people consume still fall short of nutritional guidelines, attitudes and values are shifting and the channels through which individuals and households purchase food are diversifying. Notable trends observed include the increasing consumption of ethical and sustainable foods, the increasing use of digital technology to facilitate food purchasing, and, recently, the widening of inequalities and increase in levels of food poverty. Box 4 below provides a summary of the trends in food consumption and attitudes reviewed in the literature.
What people consume still falls 
short of dietary guidelines 
Healthy diets typically include greater 
consumption of fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and reduced consumption of sugar, salt, processed foods and red meat (Defra, 2017; WHO, 2004; Public Health England, 2018). While UK national nutrition surveys indicate some positive changes to diets, people are generally not meeting the standards recommended for a healthy diet in the UK or internationally (de Ridder et al., 2017; Micha et al., 2015). There is strong evidence to suggest

at least five portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables a day (Policy Navigator, 2003).that the UK population continues to consume too much salt, sugar, and saturated fat, and not enough fruit, vegetables, and fibre (Defra, 2017; Kamar et al., 2016; PHE & FSA, 2019), with most people eating less than ‘5 a day’.
13 Trends 
from various national surveys show no change (PHE & FSA, 2019) or even reductions in fruit and vegetable consumption, with purchases falling by 5.2 per cent between 2008 and 2015 (Defra, 2017; NHS Digital, 2018). Evidence from the National Diet and Nutrition survey indicates that there is some reduction in the consumption of red and processed meat, from 75 per cent of respondents in 2012 to 55 per cent in 2018 (FSA, 2019b; PHE & FSA, 2019). There is some evidence, both in terms of household purchases and consumption data, to suggest that sugar consumption is falling (by 7.3 per cent between 2012 and 2015) (Defra, 2017; PHE & FSA, 2019), including sugar sweetened beverages (PHE & FSA, 2019), but levels of consumption of both remain high (Defra, 2017; Ng et al., 2012; PHE & FSA, 2019). Some evidence also indicates that salt consumption has fallen in the UK, falling 2.4 per cent between 2012 and 2015 (Defra, 2017), but remains above recommended levels (Caraher & Hughes, 2019; Defra, 2017; PHE & FSA, 2019).
