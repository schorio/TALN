Food consumption in the UK
There is some evidence that 
clear and simple information can influence consumersâ€™ food purchases
Some studies highlight the role of information, 
including guidelines and labelling, in driving food purchasing (Apostolidis & McLeay, 2016; Christoph et al., 2016; D. A. Cohen & Lesser, 2016; Ghvanidze et al., 2017; Hodgkins et al., 2019; Omar et al., 2014; Palma et al., 2017; Saltmarsh, 2014). In the UK, 36 per cent of consumers have made changes to their consumption practices at least once in their life based on food information (European Food Safety Authority, 2019). 
There is strong evidence that how information 
is provided influences the relative importance of information for consumers. Consumers tend to act on information when it is provided in clear and simple formats (Hodgkins et al., 2019; Kelly et al., 2016). For example, the use of front-of-pack labelling is challenging for consumers when there are different formats used on different food products (Draper et al., 2013). The source of food information and its influence on consumer trust is not widely covered in the academic literature, but the grey literature reports on the types of information that consumers find more reliable. There is moderate evidence that consumers most frequently get information on food from television (69 per cent of respondents in the EU and 61 per cent respondents in the UK), followed by the Internet (46 per cent in the EU and 56 per cent in the UK), newspapers and magazines (38 per cent in the EU and 41 per cent in the UK), and family and social circles (36 per cent in the EU and 33 per cent in the UK). Younger respondents in the EU prefer information from social media and the Internet (European Food Safety Authority, 2019). The source of information also affects the trust that consumers in the EU have in food information (European Food Safety Authority, 2010, 2019).
