Annex A. Approach and methodology
Aims and overarching approach
RAND Europe was commissioned by Defra to 
provide a state-of-the art review of consumer attitudes and practices
38 to food in the UK, in 
support of Defra’s broad programme of work across food and consumers. The review is not intended to feed into any one specific stream of work, rather to provide a resource that Defra can draw upon to inform their overall strategy and support multiple strands of work. The objectives of the study are to identify the strengths of existing evidence regarding:
•The drivers of consumer food practices.
•The trends related to food consumption39
patterns in the UK, including internationalcomparisons.
•The role of information in foodconsumption practices.
•The role of different food systems actors(e.g. producers, retailers, service providers)and their relationship to consumerpractices.
•The role and relevance of socio-economicand socio-demographic factors in foodpractices and consumption patterns.
•The trends related to the changing foodenvironment (including the out-of-homesector, online retail models and other foodconsumption models) and associatedopportunities and challenges.We combined these elements to identify four overarching aims and objectives, which are to collate evidence on: 
1.Trends related to consumer food practicesand attitudes and to the changing foodenvironment (e.g. out-of-home sector,online retail models) in the UK and throughinternational comparisons.
2.Drivers of consumption (e.g. the role ofinformation or food system actors).
3.Policy interventions that can influence foodconsumption decisions.
4.Differences between groups, or ‘foodpublics’ (Darnton, 2016), across thetrends, drivers and policy interventions (i.e.segmentation).
The focus of this study is on identification of existing evidence and evidence gaps within high-quality (primarily academic) literature. The study approach consisted of a rapid evidence assessment (REA). REAs are similar to systematic reviews in taking a robust and replicable approach to searching and reviewing the literature. However, they take a slightly more pragmatic approach to the scope and coverage of literature, limiting study inclusion by using a range of criteria that can be adjusted in response to the volume of literature identified, enabling them to be conducted within a more limited timeframe. The remaining sections set out our approach across five tasks:
