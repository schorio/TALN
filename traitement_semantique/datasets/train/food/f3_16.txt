Knowledge 
and 
information Information campaigns also rely on personal agency in changing practices, and evidence consistently indicates that they tend to have greater impact in individuals with higher socio-economic status and thus possibly widen inequalitiesHigh Widely coveredChandon, 2013; Christoph et al., 2016; Friel et al., 2015; Garnett et al., 2015; McGill et al., 2015
Use of food labelling information is particularly high among individuals with health conditions and special dietary requirements and notably lower among children, adolescents, older adults and people in lower socio-economic groupsHigh Widely coveredCampos et al., 2011
