AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES THAT PROMOTE 
HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY AND 
NUTRITION
Nutritionally friendly agriculture technology practices are very 
important in diversifying the household food and nutrient intake and 
also ensure that at least each meal the family is served has a protective, body building and energy giving food groups.
Nutritional well-being requires access to enough nutritious and safe food 
to meet the dietary needs of all members of the household throughout the year. Attaining better food supplies and nutritional well-being is more than just producing enough food locally. It also requires sufficient resources (such as land and labour), tools, skills and knowledge. Roads and transport to markets are necessary so that food and other essentials can be traded. Also, household members can find employment as well as have access to other commercial and government services.
For enhanced nutrition, agricultural practices that promote increased 
production and access of highly nutritious foods are emphasized in the community. Likewise, quality and safety of food produced should be maintained throughout the entire value chain. Good Agricultural Prac-tices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) prevent foodborne diseases attributed to livestock and crops.
Zoonotic diseases such as salmonellosis are from eggs, brucellosis and 
tuberculosis from milk and meats and aflatoxin from maize and ground -
nuts should also be prevented.
It is therefore important to have built-in nutrition consideration that 
ensures access, safety and stability of nutritious foods.
