181) Acute malnutrition: Underweight/wasting
Acute malnutrition takes place within a short time and can present loss 
of muscles in bulk. When severe, presents with visible wasting (promi -
nence of bones) and/or symmetrical swelling of the body starting from 
both feet.
2) Chronic malnutrition: Stunting
A childâ€™s height is one of the most important indicator of his/her well-
being. Height reflects the accumulated total of early-life health and 
diseases. The problems that prevent children from growing tall also 
prevent them from growing into healthy, productive, smart adults. Height 
predicts adult economic outcomes. Chronic undernutrition that affects 
children right from pregnancy to 5 years of age affects their growth and leads to reduced growth in stature (short-for-age). Chronic malnutrition is due to prolonged long term deprivation of proper nutrients/foods to 
children.
