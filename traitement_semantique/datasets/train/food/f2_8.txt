Wakame seaweed
Undaria pinnatifida2
Cultivated for centuries by sea farmers in Korea 
and Japan, deep-green coloured wakame is 
rich in nutrients and easy to grow. Maintaining 
similar properties to other seaweeds, it can be 
harvested all year round, grows rapidly without 
the use of fertilisers or pesticides and supports 
the waterâ€™s biological balance. Beyond Asia, it 
is farmed in sea fields in France, New Zealand, 
California and Argentina.In addition to containing a variety of vitamins 
and minerals, wakame is one of the few 
plant-based sources of the omega 3 fatty acid 
EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), which is found 
almost exclusively in fatty fish that feed on 
algae12. Most commonly sold dried and then 
rehydrated, wakame has a savoury flavour 
and satin-like texture. It can be chopped 
and added to soups or fried and thrown into 
salads, stir-fries, and side dishes  
for a salty, umami flavour.
