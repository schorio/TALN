Why food consumption matters
The health and environmental 
impacts of our food choices 
Obesity4 is a global pandemic influenced by the 
food environment5 and individual choices (FAO, 
2018; Meldrum et al., 2017; WHO, 2004). Global 
obesity rates have more than tripled since 1975 and levels of obesity in the UK are amongst the worst in Europe (OECD, 2017). In the UK, 29 per cent of adults are obese, and by age 11 so are 20 per cent of children (NHS Digital, 2019). This is a ‘blatantly visible – yet most neglected’ public health challenge (WHO, 2004) and nutritionally poor and unhealthy diets are one of the main factors that make individuals overweight (Public Health England, 2017). 
Being overweight

and nutrition, puts people at risk of ill health and 
premature death (NHS Digital, 2019) through conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, musculoskeletal, liver and dental disease (WHO, 2004). In the UK alone, obesity-related illness is responsible for more than 30,000 deaths per year and on average deprives an individual of an extra nine years

United Nations as the environments that constitute the food that is available to people’s everyday lives and the safety, 
price, convenience, labelling and promotion, and nutritional quality of these foods. It encompasses both the physical and social contexts within which food consumption occurs (FAO, 2016).

as a result of being overweight obese is also expensive. Between 2014 and 2015, the NHS spent an estimated £6.1 billion on weight-related ill health; more than is spent annually on the police, fire service and the judicial system combined (Public Health England, 2017). Poor diet puts people at risk of poor health, but these risks are not equally distributed across populations, with low income groups at greatest risk of having a low-quality diet and the accompanying health problems (Gakidou et al., 2017). 
Consumption practices also have an impact on 
the environment. Food production, transport and packaging can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss and plastic and food waste. Food systems contribute between 10–29 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions (Defra & Government Statistical Service, 2019; Garnett et al., 2015) through agriculture, preproduction and post-production food processes (Vermeulen et al., 2012). Consumption practices also significantly affect deforestation, which is the main cause 1
