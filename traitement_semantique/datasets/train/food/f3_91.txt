Food consumption in the UK
Box 7 Summary of key evidence gaps in the existing literature
Trends
• The effect of demographic variables on consumption is not well understood as analyses 
are often not adequately controlled for the interaction of these variables with other factors (e.g. correlation between age and wealth). 
• Research indicates some differences in consumer practices when shopping online compared to offline, but the overall effects of the changing food environment on consumption, such as increased online and out-of-home purchasing, is not well understood. For example, patterns and frequency of use of different types of outlet are not clear, and the ways in which food options are presented affect consumption in an online setting are not well established.
• The extent to which ethical and environmental concerns influence consumption is unclear beyond information on purchasing data on specific food types (e.g. Fairtrade). Similarly, though some consumers increasingly care about the provenance of their food and production methods, the relative importance of these considerations and their influence on consumption are unknown.
• A value-action gap persists and there is some evidence on why this might be the case; however, there is very little evidence on how and when that gap can be closed.
Drivers
• The role of digital technology, both in terms of a route to purchase food, and as a source of information and a vehicle for advertising, is not well understood and is likely to continue to increase in importance. More evidence is needed on how new technologies and new and existing platforms (e.g. social media) impact on consumption. 
• Although there is a growing evidence base on the influence of the built and micro environment on consumption, there are still important gaps that require further investigation, such as the impact of socio-demographic differences in access to fast-food outlets and the impact of planning policies on consumption.
• Although the literature cites a variety of food system actors as being important in influencing the food environment and consumption practices, there is no evidence on their relative importance.
Social differences
• Some of the evidence around social differences in consumption comes from cross-sectional data, which means it is unclear whether interventions could effectively address those differences by changing those personal factors or circumstances. More longitudinal data would be helpful to better understand whether interventions can be effective in changing consumption.
