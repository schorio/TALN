and 
information Information campaigns also 
rely on personal agency in changing practices, and evidence consistently indicates that they tend to have greater impact in individuals with higher socio-economic status and thus possibly widen inequalitiesHigh Widely coveredChandon, 2013; Christoph et al., 2016; Friel et al., 2015; Garnett et al., 2015; McGill et al., 2015
Use of food labelling information is particularly high among individuals with health conditions and special dietary requirements and notably lower among children, adolescents, older adults and people in lower socio-economic groupsHigh Widely coveredCampos et al., 2011
Labels in restaurants and fast-food settings may only have effects in certain population subgroups, with some evidence that women may use menu labels whereas men do notLowâ€“moderateNot widely coveredSinclair et al., 2014
Cost and 
contentPrice changes through taxes or subsidies are regressive and disproportionately have more impact on those with lower incomes because they spend a larger proportion of their income on food and because they tend to buy relatively cheaper foods; even where taxes are regressive, those on lower incomes may still benefit proportionately more from subsidies on fruit and vegetables if they buy themModerate Some evidenceBarrett et al., 2017; Jensen et al., 2011; McGill et al., 2015; Thow et al., 2010 
Source: RAND Europe analysis. This table is a summary of the evidence on socio-demographic differences in food consumption cited in the literature reviewed. It serves to highlight the differences and nuances in behaviour and practices related to food. It is not intended as a segmentation and cannot be used to draw predictable conclusions about consumption behaviour.
