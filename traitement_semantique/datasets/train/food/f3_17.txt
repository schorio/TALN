Cost and 
contentPrice changes through taxes or subsidies are regressive and disproportionately have more impact on those with lower incomes because they spend a larger proportion of their income on food and because they tend to buy relatively cheaper foods; even where taxes are regressive, those on lower incomes may still benefit proportionately more from subsidies on fruit and vegetables if they buy themModerate Some evidenceBarrett et al., 2017; Jensen et al., 2011; McGill et al., 2015; Thow et al., 2010 
Source: RAND Europe analysis. This table is a summary of the evidence on socio-demographic differences in food consumption cited in the literature reviewed. It serves to highlight the differences and nuances in behaviour and practices related to food. It is not intended as a segmentation and cannot be used to draw predictable conclusions about consumption behaviour.
Future priorities for policy and 
research 
The literature reviewed highlights significant 
gaps in the evidence base. Some factors have high-quality evidence but are not extensively written about in the academic literature. Other factors have low- or moderate-quality evidence in the academic literature. Table 3 provides a 
summary overview of areas explored in the literature on food consumption behaviours and practices, and the interventions to change these, and illustrates both the quality and availability of the evidence for each factor. Building on this, Box 2 summarises a number of key evidence 
gaps in the existing literature regarding trends, drivers and interventions. Based on these key evidence gaps, there are a number of priority areas that policymakers could consider, which are presented below and summarised in Box 3.
