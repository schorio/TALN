30 Percent of Calories and Saturated Fat
That Provides 10 Percent
Several scientific groups suggest that Americans
moderate the amount of fat in their diets. Some

provides 10 percent of calories for diets at several
different daily calorie levels. The amounts of
saturated fat are given in upper limits because of
that type of fatâ€™s ability to raise blood cholesterol
