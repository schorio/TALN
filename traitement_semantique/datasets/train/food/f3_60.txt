indicates that women tend to have slightly 
greater consumption of healthier foods (Defra, 2017; Micha et al., 2015). Women are also more likely to pay more for healthy foods and use food labels (Balcombe et al., 2010; Christoph et al., 2016; Rekhy & McConchie, 2014). Age differences are also associated with dietary differences (Palma et al., 2017; Price et al., 2016). The same global survey also found that intake of more healthy foods was generally higher in older adults (Micha et al., 2015). Some studies find a  correlation between age and fruit and vegetable consumption, where fruit and vegetable consumption increases with age until 60–65, after which it starts to decline (Appleton et al., 2017; Rekhy & McConchie, 2014). Older individuals also tend to consume healthier foods overall, although it is not clear whether this a true age effect or a cohort effect (Appleton et al., 2017; Lam & Adams, 2017). Analysis of UK food purchase data (controlling for equivalised income)
30 found 
that consumption of healthier foods (e.g. fruit and vegetables, oil-rich fish and fibre) was lower and consumption of less healthy foods was higher in Scotland than in England, and this discrepancy was greater for lower-income groups (Barton et al., 2015). However, evidence for these factors is less clear, particularly as these studies are not all adequately controlled. Despite these socio-demographic differences, diets remain unhealthy across all groups. Collectively, these findings suggest that existing policies have not adequately addressed food inequalities.

(Eurostat, 2018).Beliefs and values can inform 
consumption, and health concerns are a greater driver of choice than other (e.g. environmental) issues
Consumers, when asked, often cite the 
importance of values and beliefs in driving their food choices. However, there are differences in the relative importance of different values such as health, environmental concerns and animal welfare for consumers. There is strong evidence that health concerns are a bigger driver of consumption than environmental concerns (e.g. sustainability) (Appleton et al., 
2017; Blow et al., 2019; Ghvanidze et al., 2017; S. Hashem et al., 2018; Mylan, 2018; K. H. Ng et al., 2015). Purchase of organic food boxes, for example, are in part driven by ethical and political motivations, such as growing concerns over the globalised and industrialised food system, and the lack of transparency in food origin; however, perceived health benefits are also a key motivator (S. Hashem et al., 2018). Similar trends are seen in meat reduction, with health perceptions being the most prominent influence, and only limited significance placed on environmental concerns and animal welfare (Appleton et al., 2017; Clark et al., 2016; Jackson, 2010; Mylan, 2018); although differences exist depending on gender, age, education and familiarity with and interest in the issue (Clark et al., 2016; Garnett et al., 2015). Evidence on the socio-demographic characteristics of individuals with health and environmental concerns suggests that these tend to be female and younger (Latvala et al., 2012; Su et al., 2019; WRAP , 2015; YouGov: Eating Better, 2019), but more good-quality and controlled studies are needed to determine this relationship.
