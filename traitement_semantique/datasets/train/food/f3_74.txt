Food consumption in the UK
size and food placement in different settings 
(e.g. supermarkets, canteens). On balance, it is likely that there are some moderate effects on consumption from these types of ‘nudges’  (Bucher et al., 2016; Cadario & Chandon, 2019; Hartmann-Boyce et al., 2018; Hollands et al., 2015; Houghtaling et al., 2019). 
Evidence suggests that these types of 
interventions may work better in some contexts than others. For example, some studies show significant effects of changes in food placement in schools (Driessen et al., 2014) and changes in prominence and portion sizes for meat (Bianchi et al., 2018). The use of end of aisle displays and shelf placement in supermarkets is known to increase sales, with an estimated 30 per cent of supermarket sales coming from aisle ends, although this likely interacts with price, price promotion and number of display locations among others (Garrido-Morgado & González-Benito, 2015; Glanz et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2014). However, other studies looking at placement and portion size in a range of settings including self-service restaurants and grocery stores found no conclusive evidence on changes in consumption (Skov et al., 2013; Walmsley et al., 2018).  
Evidence and conclusions on the effectiveness 
of changes to the micro environment are in part limited by a lack of good quality studies and the fact that many studies are conducted in a lab rather than a real-world setting (Bucher 
et al., 2016; Driessen et al., 2014; Hartmann-Boyce et al., 2018; Skov et al., 2013). The 
acceptability of nudges to consumers is also a possible concern (Cadario & Chandon, 2019; Diepeveen et al., 2013). For example, the acceptance of a nudge has been found to be inversely related to its effectiveness, with less acceptance of for example portion and package size reductions compared with those that act to inform consumers (Cadario & Chandon, 2019). However, approval increased with perceived effectiveness, suggesting that individuals are poor judges of which nudges are effective (Cadario & Chandon, 2019). More generally, there is also less support for interventions perceived as more intrusive and that target individuals rather than businesses (Diepeveen et al., 2013).  
Cost and content of food
Changing the cost and content of food available is another possible policy measure that can change consumption. There is some evidence that these approaches can be effective; although in the case of price changes, the difference in price has to be quite significant to make an impact and this depends on the income level of the person. However, understanding of the overall effectiveness of these changes is limited by the complexity of possible substitution effects; when content or cost of foods change, industry and consumers may change their behaviour but not necessarily in the way that is intended. 
Food taxes and subsidies can affect 
consumption, but the changes in price need to be relatively large to make a difference
Systematic reviews suggest that taxes 
and subsidies can affect purchasing and consumption, encouraging the consumption of healthier foods and reducing the consumption of less healthy options (Afshin et al., 2017; Eyles et al., 2012; Hartmann-Boyce et al., 2018; Ng et al., 2012; Niebylski et al., 2014; Thow et al., 2010). However, the size of price changes needs to be quite significant (at least 20 per cent) to make a difference (Andreyeva et al., 2010; Niebylski et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2018; Wright et al., 2017). There is evidence that subsidies might lead to bigger changes in consumption than taxation. A meta-analysis suggests a 10 per cent subsidy/price reduction
