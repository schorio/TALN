Beans and other pulses are members of the legume 
family. They can convert nitrogen from the air and ‘fix’ it 
into a form that can be readily used by plants. More than 
environmental superheroes, beans offer us a rich source 
of fibre, protein and B vitamins. They are eaten in many 
dishes all over the world and have a mild flavour and 
meat-like texture, making them a sensible swap for meat 
in stews, soups and sauces.
