 b) Body-building foods (“GROW” foods)
Foods rich in protein are called body-building foods or “GROW” foods. 
These foods help to maintain life and promote growth, repair worn out and damaged body tissues. “GROW” foods come from animal and plant sources. Milk, meat, eggs and fish are good sources of animal proteins while legumes and nuts are good sources of plant protein. Animal protein sources are considered to be of high quality compared to plant sources, apart from soybeans.
