Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers38Advantages 	of	breastfeeding
• Breast milk is the best nutritionally balanced food for the baby. It 
contains all the nutrients required by the baby in the correct pro-
portions. The nutrients are in forms that are easy for the baby to 
digest and absorb.

tions and stay healthy. Most of these substances are found in the 
yellowish milk (colostrum) that is produced in the first few days 
afterbirth.
• Breast milk is released at a correct temperature suitable for baby.
• Breast milk is safe, there is no danger of contamination during preparation.
• Breast feeding is relatively cheap compared to other alternatives.
• Breast feeding promotes bonding between mother and baby.
• Delays return of menstruation and delays the next pregnancy there-by spacing the children.
• Helps the mother to shrink the uterus back to its normal size.
• Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months helps a child’s mental (brain) development.
