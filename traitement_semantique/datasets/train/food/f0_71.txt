Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers60SUMMARY
• Minimize storage losses attributable to harvesting, weevils 
and farm processing.
• Harvest food at the right stage of maturity (avoid harvesting immature or over-mature produce in case of fruits don’t har -
vest under ripe or over ripe ones).
• Avoid physical or mechanical damage during harvesting, transportation and handling of foods.
• Avoid drying, shelling, threshing and winnowing food on bare ground (problems with contamination by microorganisms, 
sand and stones).
• Sort and clean the food to remove diseased and poor quality 
produce and impurities.
• Make sure that the produce is prepared under hygienic condi -
tions all the time.
• Recommended storage practices are very important for both perishables (fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, fish, poultry 
and eggs) and non-perishables like cereals and legumes).
• Maintain hygienic environment wherever food is produced 
and handled.
• Practice appropriate food preservation in homes, e.g., drying, smoking or salting of meat and fish, preservation of fruits and 
vegetables by use of solar drying.
• Discourage processing practices that contaminate the agricul-
ture harvest.
• Promote good storage practices that ensure safe and nutri -
tious foods.
• Not all food should go to the market.
• Use income from non-food items to buy food.
