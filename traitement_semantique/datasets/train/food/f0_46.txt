Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers35Nutrition 	for	breastfeeding 	mothers
Nutritional requirements during breastfeeding are higher than during 
pregnancy because the mother has to produce enough milk to sustain a baby (bigger than the foetus) for the first six months and beyond. Breast -
feeding women need to eat a wide variety of foods.
Nutrition guidelines for pregnant women as well apply here but a 
lactating mother needs to eat much more; that is to say one extra meal (five meals in total).
Breastfeeding mothers should also take a lot of fluids to cater for the 
high amounts of water used to make breast milk. They should avoid self-medication, smoking and alcohol to prevent intoxicating the baby.
Breastfeeding mothers should avoid stress and have enough rest.KEY MESSAGES 
• Ensure that a pregnant mother has a balanced diet, with a vari-

in addition to the 3 meals she receives daily. The fourth meal 
caters to her physiological needs.
