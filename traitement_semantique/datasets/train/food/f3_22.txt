Box 3 Summary of possible priority areas for further consideration by policymakers
Priority area 1: A ‘whole systems’ approach is needed to change food consumption
• A combination of coordinated and complementary approaches across the spectrum of 
policy categories is likely to be most effective at changing consumer diets to ensure they are sustainable, affordable and healthy.
• Combining individual-level policies (e.g. information and knowledge provision) with collective, population-level approaches (e.g. focusing on the food environment, and cost and content of food) could help to promote sustainable, affordable and healthier food choices.
Priority area 2: Invest in evaluations of the effectiveness of interventions that target the wider (and changing) food environment
• Although individuals are often aware that eating a healthy diet and being physically active is necessary, many are constrained and influenced by their food environment (i.e. the availability of food, marketing, advertising, food placement and portion sizes). 
• More evaluations of interventions, supported by good-quality real-world data, are needed that target the built and micro food environment (including online and out of home) to address the availability of unhealthy food. 
Priority area 3: Gather real-world evidence around subsidies, taxes and reformulation programmes to better understand the potential substitution effects
• Understanding of the overall effectiveness of prices, subsidies and reformulation of foods is limited by a lack of understanding of possible substitution effects.
• It would be important to conduct more real-world evaluations and studies to better understand the impacts of these policies.
Priority area 4: Collect evidence on longer-term outcomes and more longitudinal data
• Most evaluations of interventions only include short-term follow-up and many often look at intermediate rather than final outcomes.
• Collecting longitudinal data and evidence on the longer-term outcomes of interventions would help to better understand what factors can result in changes in consumption practices. This should form an ongoing activity alongside implementing interventions to address food consumption.
