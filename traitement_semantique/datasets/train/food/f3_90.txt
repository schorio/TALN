Ethical and environmental 
concerns Unclear whether these concerns influence consumption A value-action gap persists High Strong  
Online purchases The role of increased online and out-of-home purchasing is not well understood Moderate Not widely covered   Drivers, individual/social differencesBuilt and micro food environment Growing but mixed evidence base on the impact of the built environment on consumption High Not widely covered  
Food actors High-quality but not extensive evidence on the relative importance of different actors High Not widely covered 
Food informationStrong evidence on the type of information that is provided to food consumers, but a lack of academic evidence exploring the type of information that can change food practicesHigh Some evidence 
Country of originConsumers state the importance of the provenance of food when choosing certain food products (particularly meat) but there is not a lot of evidenceModerate Not widely covered  
Food quality There is moderate evidence that perceived food quality is an important driver for consumer choice Moderate Some evidence 
Online purchases The role of the changing digital landscape and its influence on food consumption is not widely covered Moderate Not widely covered  
Segmentation Often specific to a particular context and not always generalisable across a population Moderate Not widely covered 
Supply-side technologiesLimited evidence that consumers consider technologies in food production processes when making food-related decisionsLow–moderateNot widely covered InterventionsMass media campaignsEvidence is still limited regarding whether it can influence behaviour change Limitations to campaign design (e.g. TV only, not online); better designed campaigns might be more effectiveModerate Not widely covered  
Food labelling Evidence on the effect of food labelling in fast-food settings, supermarkets and restaurants is mixed Low-moderate Some evidence   
Advertising regulationCan impact consumption but the evidence is limited Limitations in both evaluation and policy design limit our knowledge of effectivenessLow–moderate Some evidence  
Food provision and procurement in other public settingsLittle research on the effectsVery little evidence identified Mixed Not widely covered  
Changes in the micro environment Mixed evidence and effectiveness of these interventions depends on context  Low Not widely covered  
Built food environment Policy actions to address the built food environment have not been widely implemented or evaluated Low Not widely covered  
Reformulation of food Substitution effects unclear; can be driven by other changes (price changes, labelling requirements) Moderate Not widely covered  
Taxes and subsidies Understanding of substitution effects limited Moderate High  
