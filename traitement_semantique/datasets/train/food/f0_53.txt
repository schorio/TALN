Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers42Picture 11: A mother encourages and supervises her child’s feeding following the six 
principles of complementary feeding practice from the age of 12 –24 months.
KEY MESSAGES 
• From 6 months and beyond, children should be fed on other 
foods on top of the mother’s breast milk. Milk should form the 
foundation of the child’s diet between the ages of 0 to 2 years.
• Use biofortified and/or fortified foods, when available; give 
vitamin/mineral supplements when animal products, fortified 
foods, or micronutrient (vitamin A, Fe & Zn) rich foods are not 
readily available.
