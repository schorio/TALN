Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers34guidelines for selecting energy-giving foods, body-building foods 
and protective foods. Pregnant women especially need foods rich in 
iron and vitamin A in addition to the balanced diet. Iron needs are 
highly increased partly due to the need to build reserves for child 
up to six months after birth before initiating complementary food 
intake.
• Pregnant women need to take foods rich in calcium, e.g., milk and mukene (silver fish) partly to take care of the increased requirement 
for building the foetus skeletal structure.
• Pregnant women have higher needs for nutrients generally and 
should take snacks in between meals.
In addition, pregnant women should be educated to strictly observe the 
following:
1. Take the required amounts of iron and folic acid supplements to 
prevent anaemia.
2. Sleep under an insecticide-treated mosquito net.
3. Visit the nearest health facility at least four (4) times for antenatal 
care. This will enable them access a number of services that prepare 
them to deliver a healthy baby.
4. Deliver in a healthy facility with the help of a skilled health worker.
5. Get deworming pills, IPT and tetanus vaccine from a health facility.6. Avoid excessive workloads therefore community and family support 
mechanisms should be encouraged.
7. Pregnant women should limit intake of alcohol, cigarettes. These 
cause negative effects on the foetus.
8. Should strictly take drugs on advice of the health personnel as some 
of them are potentially harmful to the unborn child.
9. Avoid negative cultural practices that reduce the intake of nutritious 
foods or impact negatively on their health such as:
• Not consuming chicken and eggs.
• Pregnant women not defecating in toilets/pit latrines.
