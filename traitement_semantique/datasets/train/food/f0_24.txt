Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers13SUMMARY
• Promote the consumption of both animal and plant foods in 
the community since minerals from plant sources are poorly 
absorbed.
• Use iodized salt for cooking.
• Consumption of animal source foods is necessary for a family 
to achieve a balanced diet.
• Animal source foods are a good source of readily digested protein and are rich in energy. Animal source foods are easily absorbable and an efficient source of micronutrients (calcium 
and B12 from milk, and iron, zinc and vitamin A).
• Animal source foods are exclusive sources of dietary vitamin 
B12, and a good source of preformed vitamin A, particularly in 
milk which protects children from diseases.
