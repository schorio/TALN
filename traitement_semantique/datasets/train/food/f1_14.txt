9Table 6. Daily Values
Daily Values have been established by the Food
and Drug Administration as references to help
consumers use information on food labels to plan a
healthy overall diet. The Daily Values provide a
reliable guide for most people. It is helpful to know
that a 2,000-calorie level is about right for
moderately active women, teenage girls, and
sedentary men, and 2,500 calories is the target level
for many men, teenage boys, and active women.Many older adults, children, and sedentary women
need fewer than 2,000 calories a day and may want
to select target levels based on 1,600 calories a day.
Some active men and teenage boys and very active
women may want to select target levels based on
2,800 calories per day. The Daily Values for
sodium and cholesterol are the same for everyone,
regardless of total calories consumed, so you do not
have to make adjustments based on your caloric
needs.

of some key nutrients you should eat each day, depending on whether you eat 2,000
or 2,500 calories a day.
