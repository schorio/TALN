Although we can see broad trends in attitudes 
and consumption practices, as well as common system level and environmental drivers, the way people respond to them differs depending on who they are, their experiences, beliefs, attitudes and other characteristics. There is no one, generalisable, public, rather there are multiple ‘food publics’
29 (Darnton, 
2016) and understanding these differences is crucial both in understanding the changing food environment and thinking about how policies can be developed to change consumption practices. Individual differences can be driven by social factors and constructs, but also by psychological factors; we discuss both of these in this chapter. Figure 10 provides an overview of the complex factors that constitute individual and social level differences. 
Socio-demographic factors are 
associated with consumption in predictable ways
There is strong evidence that lower incomes, 
economic deprivation and lower levels of education are associated with a poorer diet and being overweight/obese (Appleton et 
29 The term ‘food publics’ is used to emphasise that in the evidence base on food and consumption, the public is 
not a single entity, but rather composed of different subgroups with different socio-demographic characteristics,  
experiences, beliefs, attitudes and other characteristics (Darnton, 2016).al., 2017; Barton et al., 2015; Bondy & Talwar, 
2011; Cribb et al., 2011; Edwards et al., 2010; Hawkesworth et al., 2017; Levin, 2014; Palma et al., 2017; Pearson et al., 2018; Pechey & Monsivais, 2016; Rekhy & McConchie, 2014; Thomas et al., 2019; Townshend & Lake, 2017). A systematic review considering the environmental determinants of a healthy diet found that low socio-economic status (in terms of education level, work status and income) is the single most consistent risk factor for not adhering to a healthy diet (de Ridder et al. 2017). Data from multiple studies and surveys indicates that compared to those with higher socio-economic status, individuals with lower socio-economic status tend to obtain a greater proportion of energy from less healthy foods and beverages (i.e. sugar-sweetened drinks, red meat products – such as processed meat, pies and sausages – whole milk, processed potatoes and takeaway foods) and fewer foods associated with a healthy diet (i.e. fruit and vegetables, brown/wholemeal bread, breakfast cereal, oil-rich fish, white fish and complex carbohydrates) (Barrett et al., 2017; Barton et al., 2015; Cribb et al., 2011; Defra, 2017; Pechey & Monsivais, 2016; Wrieden et al., 2013). Socio-economic differences affect children too. A higher level of parental education is associated Individual and social differences 
– how do different people make decisions about food?4
