of the overall effectiveness of these types 
of interventions is limited by a lack of understanding of possible substitution effects. Studies based on real-world data – for example initial evaluations of the SDIL and minimum pricing on alcohol – are showing positive emerging effects. Similarly, reformulation initiatives can adopt different approaches with varying levels of success; whereas voluntary programmes have led to mixed responses from industry, mandatory regulatory approaches, including restrictions and standards, pricing and labelling requirements, seem most effective in driving significant changes in consumption. However, these are only initial evaluations, and many studies are based on modelling, which may not adequately account for substitution effects. Therefore, more evaluations of this type of initiative that take into account substitution effects are warranted.
