Kitchen and housekeeping
• The kitchen and house should be kept clean because it can be a seri-
ous cause of food contamination if it is not well tended to.
• The inside of the house should be kept neat and invitingly well orga-nized/arranged to allow thorough cleaning.
• The kitchen should have a door for the safety of the items kept there.
• Keep the inside of the house tidy by regular cleaning.
• It should have good ventilation to avoid growth of fungi and mould.
• There should be a simple rubbish bin for putting in refuse before disposal into the compost pit. The rubbish bin should have a cover.
• Use fuel saving stoves.
• Do not sleep with animals in the same house.
• If the house is not cemented, it should be smeared at least once a month.
