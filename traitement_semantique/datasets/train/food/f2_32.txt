Moringa
Moringa oleifera 28
Moringa, also called the drumstick or horseradish tree, is often referred to as ‘the miracle 
tree’ because of its exceptional qualities. It is fast-growing and drought-resistant. The 
trees form a natural windbreak, helping to prevent soil erosion in countries such as 
Haiti. The leaves are highly nutritious and grow plentifully all year round. Many 
parts of the tree are used in traditional medicine throughout India and Asia. 
Products containing moringa have recently gained in popularity as health 
supplements due to their nutritional value. 
Moringa can be added to a variety of dishes. When cooked, the leaves 
have a similar flavour to other leafy green vegetables and can be 
swapped for them. It can also be turned into a powder to be used in 
smoothies, soups, sauces and teas, or cooked into curries or baked 
goods to add extra flavour and give a nutritious boost43. It contains 
vitamins A, B, and C, calcium, iron and amino acids, which are 
essential for good health. 
In some countries, such as the Philippines and Indonesia, it is 
common to cut the long seed pods (known as ‘drumsticks’) into 
shorter lengths to be stewed in curries and soups. The flowers can 
be added to salads, fried as a snack, or used to make tea. Some 
popular dishes that feature moringa are South Indian sambar made 
with lentils, Thai kaeng som curry, and Filipino tinola and udan.
