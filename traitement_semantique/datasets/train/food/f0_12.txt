FOOD
What is food?
Food is anything liquid, semi-solid or solid which contains nutrients and 
energy and when taken or eaten nourishes the body.
Food contains important substances which provide energy to move, 
think, work, run our body systems, keep us healthy, help to boost our immune system and protect us from infections. When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored. The food we eat or take is used for growth, maintenance and body functions.
