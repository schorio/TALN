promote	nutrition.  Intercropping or crop rotation is one of the farming 
systems that has soil health and nutrition benefits. Legumes are ideal 
for intercropping with other crops because they fix nitrogen in the soil 
resulting in high yields from improved soil health. Others include:
• Agroforestry
• Integrated farming systems (animal & plants)
• Soil and water conservation practices
• Organic/sustainable agriculture
3) Promote use of labour saving technologies. The use of labour 
saving technologies such as rain water harvesting; use of animal trac-
tion (ploughing, carrying manure/ mulch, water, firewood and harvest), improved cooking stoves, planting of woodlots, minimum tillage (use of pesticides and herbicides) will reduce women workload and allow ample time for child care.
4) Control diseases, agricultural chemical and veterinary drug resi -
dues	associa ted 	with 	f ood 	pr oduction 	s ystems. 	These diseases can be 
broadly classified as follows:
• Water-associated/waterborne diseases caused by use of contami-
nated water from faecal material (cholera) and chemical intoxica-
tion. In addition, diseases caused by vectors living in stagnant water 
and or storage systems (Malaria, schictosomiasis/bilharzia worms, 
River blindness).
• Zoonoses diseases are diseases transmitted from animals to human 
being. Examples include: tuberculosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis, rabies, SARS/avian influenza and ebola.
Control of these diseases is important because they can be trans -
mitted to human beings, imposing on them poor health and atten-
dant undesirable nutrition related effects including the disease 
burden.
