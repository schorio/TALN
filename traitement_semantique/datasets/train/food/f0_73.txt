Importance of food safety in Uganda
• As the country develops, an increasing percentage of the population 
is eating food prepared from outside the home or at least processed 
away from home. The majority of the market participants in the 
food industry are not aware of food safety issues and this is increas-
ingly exposing the population to unsafe food consumption.
• Current practices of food production, postharvest handling, process-
ing, packaging, transportation, retailing and food preparation in the 
homes, street food vending and some restaurants may lead to food 
becoming unsafe for consumption.
• Food safety related illnesses and problems such as cancer preva-lence are now a common occurrence in Uganda.
• Much of this burden of illness results from basic sanitation failures that occur in food production, processing, storage, transportation, retailing and handling in the home or streets, restaurants and ho -
tels.
