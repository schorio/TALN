Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food
Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They 
are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various 
body functions that help someone to live.
Major	nutrients 	in	human	nutrition
Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories:  
macronutrients, micronutrients and water.
1) Macronutrients
These are required in large amounts:
• Carbohydrates
• Proteins
• Fats/oils
Carbohydrates
These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include 
starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and 
sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight.
Carbohydrate requirements
Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys-
ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body 
energy/calorie requirements of 2000
–3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram 
of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories.
Proteins
Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel-
opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.
