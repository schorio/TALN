Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers66• Greater use of wooden pallets for drying, natural fibre bags, hermet -
ic bags and various categories of insecticides could all help improve 
the quality of products and their readiness for storage.
• Proper produce storage practices. The ideal storage consists of dry, 
impermeable spaces kept at low temperature. If crops are kept on 
damp floors or in pits (even in bags) or humidity rises above 80 per -
cent, the likelihood of Aspergillus  growth and aflatoxin production is 
very high.
• Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into 
consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast -
ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the 
household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed 
contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for 
consumption by households.
• Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: 
social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam-
paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at 
the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and 
promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under -
standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.
KEY MESSAGE 
Agriculture interventions cannot ensure food security and nutri -
tion without considering food safety. Integrate food safety issues 
in the whole food value chain (production, postharvest handling, marketing and consumption) as part of increasing the nutrition sensitivity of agriculture activities.
