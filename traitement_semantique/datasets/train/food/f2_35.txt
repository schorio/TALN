There are more than 2,000 edible varieties of mushrooms. 
Cultivated for centuries for their taste and nutritional value, 
mushrooms are rich in B vitamins and vitamin D as well as 
protein and fibre45. Mushrooms can also grow where many 
other foods would not, including on by-products recycled 
from other crops. They are not considered plants as they 
do not photosynthesise; they are classified as fungi. Their 
texture and umami flavour make them a tasty addition 
and a suitable substitute for meat.
