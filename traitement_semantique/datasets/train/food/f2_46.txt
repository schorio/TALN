Chickpeas, also known as garbanzo beans, are small, yellowish round beans orginally 
popular in Middle Eastern dishes. They have recently gained popularity in Western 
countries, being added to salads and made into spreads, mainly hummus. They 
have a rich, creamy and nutty flavour. With one cup of chickpeas providing 
approximately ten grams of protein and a somewhat meaty texture, they 
are a viable substitute for meat in many dishes. Chickpeas are good for you 
and sprouted chickpeas are even better. They’re also crunchier and have 
more flavour.
Chickpeas are one of the easiest beans to sprout. Doing so neutralises 
the phytic acid and allows the body to better absorb the nutrients, 
such as calcium, magnesium and zinc51. To sprout chickpeas, soak 
for eight hours, drain and rinse. Transfer to a glass jar or bowl and 
cover with a cheesecloth. Repeat the rinse and drain steps a few 
times until the sprouts are to the desired length. This usually takes 
three to four days. Like all sprouts, sprouted chickpeas are 
prone to bacterial growth, so it’s important to follow good 
safety principles. 
Add them to stews, soups, stir-fries, or simply enjoy as a side 
dish. Hummus made from sprouted chickpeas has more 
crunch and a nuttier flavour than unsprouted chickpeas.Category Sprouts
