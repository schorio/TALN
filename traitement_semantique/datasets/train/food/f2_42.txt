Root vegetables are the crisp and colourful underground 
parts of plants that are eaten as vegetables. They often 
have leafy tops that grow above the ground that should 
also be eaten to optimise the amount of food these 
nutritious plants can provide. Root vegetables contain a 
wide variety of vitamins and minerals and are hardy, cool-
season crops. Once harvested, they survive for a relatively 
long time compared with other vegetables.
