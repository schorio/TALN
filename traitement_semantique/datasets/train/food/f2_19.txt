Cereals and grains are considered the most important 
source of food for human consumption26. They have 
been the principal component of diets for thousands of 
years and, therefore, have played a vital role in shaping 
human civilisation27. For both environmental and health 
reasons, there is a pressing need to vary the types of 
cereals and grains grown and eaten. Diversifying sources 
of carbohydrates from white rice, maize, wheat and other 
staples, to these less common, whole cereals and grains 
will provide more nutritional value and help improve soil 
health. Many of them are readily available whilst others 
need to be brought back into the food system. Demand 
for, and supply of, a variety of less common crops needs 
to be carefully and sustainably increased to help improve 
diets and agricultural biodiversity.
