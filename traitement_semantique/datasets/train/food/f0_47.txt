Nutrition 	for	children	0	to	6	months
Breastfeeding and complementary feeding behaviours are important predictors of infant and child nutrition, health and survival. Breast milk is the best food for babies and is all the baby needs up to six months of age. Children from birth to six months of age should be exclusively breastfed. If you introduce any food before six months you will poten-tially expose the baby to unsafe and poor quality meals.
Exclusive breastfeeding refers to feeding a child on breast milk only for 
the first six months. Mothers are advised to breastfeed their babies as many times as the baby demands to be fed (at least 8 times a day, every 2â€“3 hours). This will help maintain milk production. Even when the child is ill, continue breast feeding.
