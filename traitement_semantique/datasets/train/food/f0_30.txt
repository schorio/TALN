Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers19b)	Micronutrient 	malnutrition 	(lack	of	minerals	and	vitamins)
This type of malnutrition is called “hidden hunger;” and is due to inad -
equate intake of dietary mineral salts and vitamins leading to vitamin 
mineral deficiencies (VMDs). This form of malnutrition cannot be identi-
fied easily except in advanced stages when clinical signs appear.
Minerals and vitamins are required by the body in very small quantities, 
they are very important in protecting the body against infections. Usually, 
their absence in the diet does not cause a person to “feel hungry.”
Micronutrient deficiency disorders of public health significance in 
Uganda are:
• Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA)
• Vitamin A deficiency (VAD)
• Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD)
• Zinc deficiency disorder (ZDD)
c)	Overnutrition
This is the excessive intake of nutrients in foods over a given period of 
time exposing individuals to poor health. Overnutrition results in over -
weight, obesity, or vitamin toxicity. Overnutrition may be caused by any 
of the following factors:
• Eating habits (overeating)
• Health conditions
• Taking too many unprescribed dietary supplements
• Lack of physical activity (sedentary lifestyle)
• Psychological factors (stress)
• Environmental factors (unsafe foods, e.g., heavy metals in food, 
peer pressure)
• Medication
• Genetic factors
