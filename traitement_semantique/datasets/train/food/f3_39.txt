Food consumption in the UK
Box 4 Summary of UK trends in food consumption and attitudes to food reviewed in the literature
Trend 1: What people consume still falls short of dietary guidelines
• UK consumers are generally not meeting the standards recommended for a healthy diet. 
• There have been reductions in salt, sugar and red and processed meat consumption but 
consumption of fruit, vegetables and fibre has shown little or no change. 
Trend 2: The channels through which consumers purchase food are diversifying
• Although UK consumers continue to buy food from large supermarkets, other forms of retailer, including mini supermarkets, have increased in popularity.
• The online grocery market is increasingly important, leading to an increase in supermarket home delivery and other forms of home delivery (e.g. vegetable boxes, Hello Fresh and Amazon Fresh).
Trend 3: The out-of-home food environment is increasingly common
• There has been significant growth in the consumption of food outside of the home and the proportion of individuals eating out on a regular basis is predicted to increase in the UK.
• The importance of the out-of-home environment is facilitated by digital technology and the expansion of online food delivery platforms, particularly new players such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats.
Trend 4: Some individuals care about the origin, sustainability and ethical production standards of their food
• There has been an increase in the sales of ethical and sustainable products over the last 10 years and an increase in the consumption of plant-based meals.
• Some consumers are concerned about food provenance and safety, although this may depend on the food group, particularly meat.
• However, many consumers demonstrate a value-action gap, in that while they state sustainable and ethical preferences, this often only translates into action if other needs are satisfied (e.g. price, availability and perceived quality), and many consumers remain unaware of social and environmental consequences of their consumption practices. The most important barrier to purchasing sustainable and ethical food cited in the literature is cost, with other barriers including perceived quality and habit.
