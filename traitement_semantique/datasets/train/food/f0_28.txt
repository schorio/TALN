MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION
This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and 
possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu -

The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households 
the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it.
What	is	malnutrition?
Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. It includes conditions, such as undernutrition, overnu-trition and micronutrient deficiency diseases (like vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency disorders and zinc deficiency).
Malnutrition affects MOSTLY people of the following categories:
• Infants and children from pregnancy to two (2) years of age
• Non-breastfed children
• Pregnant and lactating women
• People suffering from chronic or infectious disease
• People are food insecure
Types	of	malnutrition
