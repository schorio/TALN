While often used as decorative plants in homes around 
the world, many species of cacti are cultivated for 
consumption. Also known as succulents, cacti store water, 
which allows them to grow in arid climates and tolerate 
drought. They also contain substantial amounts of vitamins 
C and E, carotenoids, fibre and amino acids. Edible cacti 
have long been a part of Mexican cuisine and the delicious 
young stem segments, usually called nopales, are the part 
most commonly used in recipes.
