“We work with hundreds of thousands of 
smallholder farmers in many countries in sub-
Saharan Africa to garner the benefits of nitrogen-
fixing grain legumes. It’s no surprise that many 
legumes made it onto the Future 50 Foods list.”
Professor Ken Giller, Wageningen University, N2Africa
N2Africa is a research-in-development project  
focused on putting nitrogen-fixing to work  
on smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa13
