WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE 
PRACTICES (WASH)
WASH practices help to prevent caregivers and other house hold 
members from contracting water-related diarrhoea diseases and 
associated food borne diseases. A healthier and stronger household is 
more economically viable and resilient in the face of nutritional chal -
lenges. WASH practices benefit everyone, and integrating these prac-
tices into nutrition care programs provides additional opportunities and 
resources to improve overall health outcomes.
Water access
• Access to safe water is considered a basic human need and, in most 
countries, a basic human right.
• For many people especially in rural communities, there is lack ac-cess to safe water.
• The negative effects of lack of access to sufficient quantities of water, water of reasonable quality, basic sanitation and hygiene are 
magnified for sick people including the malnourished clients.
• The added burden of unsafe water affects not only the malnour -
ished individual, but the entire family, increasing the risk of diar -
rhoea disease and lost productivity.
Water quality
• Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is 
contaminated between the source and the home.
• Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of 
water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes 
comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling 
and disposal of faeces.
• Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo -
rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of 
filters; proper boiling.
