Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers61D) FOOD SAFETY IN AGRICULTURE
Issues of food safety are gaining prominence each and every day world -
wide because of urbanization, changing food habits, preferences, life-
styles and food preparation methods. Street foods, food vending, restau-rants and hotels have become quite common of recent.
Food becomes unsafe for human consumption when the concentrations 
of the following (referred to as hazards) are above tolerance levels:
• Microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses), parasites
• Biological toxins such as mycotoxins
• Physical materials like metal chips, sand, faecal material, stones
• Chemical residues including heavy metals such as lead, mercury, 
copper and others
Microorganisms including (bacteria, fungi, viruses) are the leading cause 
of food poisoning in the world. Physical aspects of food items affected by 
microbial activity with potential toxin formation include the following:
• Discoloration
• Mouldy and other unpleasant tastes
• Production of off odour
Aflatoxins caused by the moulds of aspergillusspp are especially asso -
ciated with occurrence of liver cancer in humans. There is also growing 
evidence that aflatoxins and mycotoxins in general can lead to reduced 
immunity and other associated effects such as incidence of HIV/AIDS and 
undernutrition. It is also linked to negative outcomes in animal growth 
and reproduction. Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics.
What is food safety?
Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to 
human beings. Food safety is the protection of consumers from injury 
or adverse health effects caused by consuming or handling spoilt, adul -
terated or badly stored foods. Generally, food safety describes the 
handling, preparation and storage of food in ways that prevent food
