Tubers grow downward, anchoring the plant into the 
ground, where they absorb and store valuable nutrients  
for use during the winter or drier months. Typically high  
in carbohydrates, they are a valuable source of energy.  
They can be eaten in a huge variety of ways, including 
boiled, baked, or as a sweetened pudding. White 
potatoes are the most common type of tuber. Growing 
and eating the less common types of tubers makes our 
food system more resilient while, in most circumstances, 
providing more nutrients.
