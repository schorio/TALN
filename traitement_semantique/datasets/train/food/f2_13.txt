There are many types of cowpeas; some are more commonly eaten than others. 
Catjang cowpeas are a less common variety. They are native to Africa but now grow 
in warm regions around the world, including Latin America, Southeast Asia and the 
southern part of the United States. Commonly cultivated for their nutty taste 
and high nutritional value, the seeds are little energy powerhouses packed 
with minerals and vitamins, including folate and magnesium. 
Protein-packed cowpeas are a quick-growing cover crop and are 
drought hardy and heat-tolerant. They are also a strong nitrogen-fixer, 
capable of thriving in poor soils and self-seeding18. Cowpeas are also 
able to withstand grazing pressures from livestock.
Cowpeas make a hearty, thick soup while their leaves can be 
enjoyed in the same ways as other leafy greens. The pods can 
also be eaten when young and are used in stews. With their outer 
coating removed, the seeds can also be ground into flour and used 
to make deep-fried or steamed patties. In Senegal, Ghana and 
Benin, the flour is used in crackers and other baked goods.
