a)	Consequences 	of	undernutrition
Child deaths, diseases and disability
• Newborns who are born small (low birth weight, that is less than 2.5 
kg) for their gestational age are more likely to die than children born 
with a healthy weight.
• A severely stunted child is four times more likely to die than a 
healthy child (Lancet 2008).
• A severely wasted child is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child (Lancet 2008).
• Micronutrient deficiencies—including vitamin A, zinc and iron—im -
pair the immune system, increasing risk of illness and death.
• Anaemia increases risk of maternal and perinatal deaths (death of infant in the womb and during the first 6 weeks of birth).
• Vitamin A deficiency causes blindness.
• Malnutrition has negative consequence on physical productivity, health and education outcomes with consequential negative im-
pacts on socioeconomic development in Uganda.
Malnutrition weakens brain development and nervous system
• Impaired brain development, poor school achievement, absentee -
ism (stunting, iron deficiency, anaemia, iodine deficiency)
• Neural tube defects: undeveloped back bone and the nervous sys-
tem (folic acid deficiency)
• Impaired foetal brain development, brain damage, severe mental retardation, or congenital abnormalities (iodine deficiency in preg -
nancy)
• Diminished income: earning capacity in adulthood
Malnutrition decreases productivity and economic growth
• When malnourished individuals are sick, they are weak and cannot perform their daily work for example sick farmers.
• Individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (particularly women) be-come tired easily and cannot work for longer hours.
