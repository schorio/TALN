6Table 4. Recommended Daily Dietary
Intakes
Table 4 shows recommended daily levels of
calories and several nutrients essential for
maintenance of good nutrition in healthy, normally
active persons. The Recommended Dietary
Allowances (RDAs) are currently being revised by
the National Academy of Sciences. The new
recommendations are called Dietary Reference
Intakes (DRIs) and include two sets of values that
serve as goals for nutrient intake—RDAs and
Adequate Intakes (AIs). The right side of table 4
presents the DRIs published in 1997-2000, with AIs
indicated by a dagger ( †). The left side of the table
includes the 1989 RDAs. More detailed information
about DRIs may be obtained from the table’s
sources (see note at end of table). Table 4 includes
only the nutrients contained in table 9.
