Food consumption in the UK
Drivers of consumption â€“ what 
influences food consumption practices?
A myriad of diverse and interconnected drivers 
shape and influence the food decisions and practices of consumers. These interact in ways that are neither fully understood nor fully predictable. Figure 2 provides an overview of the strength of evidence regarding the influence of these drivers.
Cost and perceived value for money  are 
significant drivers of consumption and often 
trump other drivers and consumer values.

consumer practices and preferences and their coverage in the literature 
Source: RAND Europe analysis. There is high-quality and consistent evidence that the factors at the top of the triangle are important drivers of consumption. The factors in the middle have high-quality sources with mixed evidence regarding the relative importance of the factor in driving consumption practices. The factors at the bottom of the triangle have moderate evidence illustrating the relative importance of the factor but are either not widely covered in the academic literature or lack high-quality sources.
