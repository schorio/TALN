CRITERIA FOR THE FUTURE 50 FOODS 
The Future 50 Foods have been selected based on their high 
nutritional value, relative environmental impact, flavour, accessibility, 
acceptability and affordability. This set of criteria is modelled after the 
Food and Agricultural Organization’s (FAO) definition of sustainable 
diets. Some of the Future 50 Foods have higher yields than similar 
crops, several are tolerant of challenging weather and environmental 
conditions, and many contain significant amounts of critical nutrients. 
Each has a story to tell.
See the full methodology at the end of the report.
The discovery of a new dish does more  
for the happiness of the human race  
than the discovery of a star.
As famously said by French gastronome,  
Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin
