Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers70• Facilitate the community to select enterprises that take care of both 
women and men needs.
• Women should be given power to access to information related to agriculture and health in order to help them care for the children 
and produce more food for the household.
• Men need to support women to reduce the work burden and free 
time for child care.
• Energy saving technologies should be adopted to free women from some of the work load to pay attention to nutrition issues of their 
children.
• Parents should be encouraged to educate both boys and girls 
because the ability to care for children is at times compromised by 
women’s lack of education, limited opportunities to earn income as 
well as lack of freedom outside the home.
• Women who are educated or at least literate easily care for their children and have a high possibility of having well fed children. Lack 
of self-esteem makes some women unable to take part in income 
generation activities. In addition, education further empowers 
women and makes them easily look for family planning services 
which can help space children.
• Well-spaced children will reduce burden on the women, improve care for both the mother and child and consequently improve nutri-
tion for the whole household.
• Extension workers should support farmers to select enterprises that 
promote household food security and nutrition and follow this up 
with adequate extension services.
• Women should be encouraged to take part in leadership roles and 
be part of the decision making process, even if it begins at village 
level. This will position women to articulate issues that promote 
food security and nutrition.
• Women should be encouraged to form and/or join savings and credit associations as this will ease their access to affordable credit 
to invest in agricultural production.
