45Believed to have originated in Iran, alfalfa has 
been cultivated for thousands of years. Its long 
growing season, adaptability and ability to 
enrich soil makes it a farmer’s delight. Gaining 
recent attention from health food enthusiasts, 
the immature and nutrient-dense alfalfa 
sprouts are used as an ingredient in a wide 
variety of dishes, ranging from raw salads to 
cooked stir-fries and pad thai.
Alfalfa sprouts can be grown industrially or at 
home in warm, moist conditions. Within one to two days of watering, the little brown seeds 
germinate, producing white shoots with pale 
green leaves that are ready to be eaten. Their 
crunch and mild flavour make them a great 
addition to sandwiches and soups. They can 
also be eaten on their own, topped with a 
light dressing. 
All sprouts grow in similar conditions to 
bacteria (warm and moist) making them prone 
to contamination, so food safety practices 
need to be followed closely.
Kidney beans are a popular and versatile 
source of protein. They make a great 
substitute for ground meat because of their 
texture and protein content. The mild flavour 
makes them the perfect carrier of seasonings 
and diverse flavours.
It’s when sprouted, however, that their 
nutritional value skyrockets to three times that 
of unsprouted kidney beans. Kidney beans are high in lectins, which are 
complex compounds that are difficult to 
digest. Therefore, as with all dried beans, 
especially the larger varieties, it is essential to 
thoroughly cook kidney bean sprouts by boiling 
in water or stock for 10 minutes. This will make 
them taste better and decrease the impact on 
the digestive system. The slight bitterness pairs 
well with sweetened sauces or dressings, and 
they are often used as toppings for soups  
and salads.
