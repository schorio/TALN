Price and ingredients:  This 
spans interventions that change 
the ingredients of foods that are available or the prices of 
those foods, making it easier and more economical to make better choices. There is evidence to suggest that changing the cost and content of food through taxes, subsidies and reformulation programmes is effective at changing consumption. There is evidence that subsidies may have a bigger impact than taxes. However, the change in price needs to be significant to have an effect and currently there is limited understanding of possible substitution effects.
3 This is partly due to a 
limitation of studies investigating these types of policies, which are often based on modelling rather than real-world data. 
3 Substitution is an important issue that is not fully understood. Taxes/price increases can lead to substitution at two 
levels: consumers may buy different (ideally healthier but potentially also unhealthy or cheaper) foods, and producers 
may replace a particular target product with other unhealthy content (for example, reducing sugar but increasing fat). There is a continuum across these possible 
policy approaches reflecting the extent to which the different approaches emphasise personal choice and freedoms, and also the potential challenges in implementation.
Studies and evaluations of most interventions 
typically do not investigate the long-term outcomes and often focus on intermediate outcomes (e.g. changes in views or awareness rather than actions). This limits the ability to determine whether interventions are effective at producing sustained changes in practices. More comprehensive and longitudinal studies and evaluations to look at active changes in consumption could help to build the evidence base to support more informed interventions.
