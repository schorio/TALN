Given the importance of food consumption 
practices to both health and the environment, and the power of actors in the system from retailers to manufacturers to influence the content and sales of food, it is crucial to understand what levers policymakers have available to influence consumption decisions, and how effective they are. This can help policymakers enable people to make healthier and more sustainable choices. Interventions have been grouped into three overarching categories:
Knowledge and information:  
Interventions that affect the knowledge and information available to people about food from advertising to labelling and other information.
Food environment: Interventions 
that change the food environment – from small changes to the layout and prominence of food to the types of food available in places people spend a lot of time, like at work and in school.Price and ingredients: Interventions that change the ingredients of foods that are available or the prices of those foods, making it easier and more economical to make better choices.
There is a continuum here across these possible approaches reflecting the extent to which the different approaches emphasise personal choice and freedoms, and also the potential challenges in implementation. Table 
4 below presents a summary of interventions reviewed for this study and evidence of their effectiveness.
