Vegetable-like fruits are eaten as vegetables and 
commonly mistaken for them. They are sweeter and, in 
most cases, contain a higher amount of carbohydrate and 
water compared to vegetables. Examples include squash, 
tomatoes, eggplants/aubergines, peppers and zucchini/
courgettes. Commonly grown in warm climates, fruit 
vegetables can be eaten in various forms and tend to be 
high in vitamin C and fibre.
