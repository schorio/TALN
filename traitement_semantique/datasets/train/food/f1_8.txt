3Table 1. Equivalents by Volume and Weight
This table contains some helpful volume and
weight equivalents. Following is an example that
illustrates how you can use the table:
Example. For milk, the nutrient profile covers a
1-cup serving (see page 20, table 9). Let’s say you
use 2 tablespoons of milk in your coffee. In table 1,
you see that 1 cup equals 16 tablespoons, so the
2 tablespoons you consume are two-sixteenths or
one-eighth of 1 cup. To find out the nutritive value
of the amount you actually consume—2
tablespoons—you need to divide the nutrient values
listed for milk by 8.
