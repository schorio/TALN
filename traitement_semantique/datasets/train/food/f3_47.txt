Food consumption in the UK
purchase of ethical and sustainable products, 
a number of studies have shown that some consumers are willing to pay a price premium for products with ethical and sustainable labels (e.g. Fairtrade) (see Akaichi et al., 2016).
However, the relative importance of cost as a 
driver of consumer purchases also interacts with other factors. These include taste, availability, the perceived healthiness of foods and the frequency with which certain food types and products are already consumed (Apostolidis & McLeay, 2019; Edwards et al., 2010; Jensen et al., 2011; Kamar et al., 2016). Figure 7 Overview of the strength of the evidence on the different drivers of trends and patterns in 
consumer practices and preferences and their coverage in the literature 
Source: RAND Europe analysis. There is high-quality and consistent evidence that the factors at the top of the triangle are important drivers of consumption. The factors in the middle have high-quality sources with mixed evidence regarding the relative importance of the factor in driving consumption practices. The factors at the bottom of the triangle have moderate evidence illustrating the relative importance of the factor but are either not widely covered in the academic literature or lack high-quality sources.
