There is some evidence to suggest that 
patterns of eating out may vary by age and socio-economic status. Whereas the out-of-home food environment (including for example restaurants, takeaway and fast-food places) is increasingly a major part of the diet of younger adults and adolescents (Adams et al., 2015; Nielsen, Siega-Riz, & Popkin, 2002; Tyrrell et al., 2017), home appears to be the most important location of food consumption for older adults, who are less likely to go to restaurants, fast-food outlets or pubs (Omar et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2018; Ziauddeen et al., 2018) . Some evidence indicates that 
children from lower income households are more likely to eat takeaway meals at home or purchase food from outside school (Adams et al., 2015; Wills, Danesi, Kapetanaki, & Hamilton, 2019). In contrast, the evidence in adults is mixed (J. Adams et al., 2015), with some evidence that adults with lower income tend to consume more takeaway meals eaten at home (ONS, 2018b), compared to those with higher income who tend to spend more on restaurant and café meals (ONS, 2018a). The literature reviewed does not provide evidence around patterns or frequency of eating out by type of out of home food outlet in children or adults. 
The proportion of individuals eating out on a 
regular basis is predicted to increase in the UK (Caraher & Hughes, 2019). Food from outside the home tends to be less healthy and associated with a higher energy content than food prepared in the home (i.e. containing high quantities of fat, sugar and salt) (Goffe et al., 2017; Jaworowska et al., 2014; Lachat et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2018) and has been associated with weight gain and other negative

on eating healthily and achieving a balanced diet (Public Health England, 2016).

This trend suggests that policies should consider the challenges presented by the out-of-home sector, which is fragmented compared with the traditional food retail market and does not have the same requirements around mandatory nutrition labelling for example (Caraher & Hughes, 2019). 
Some individuals care about the 
origin, sustainability and ethical production standards of their food 
There is increasing awareness about 
the negative environmental impact of food production systems, with moves to develop more sustainable dietary guidelines (Apostolidis & McLeay, 2016; Lang & Mason, 2018). For example, the UK government’s Eatwell Guide,
16 published in 2016, has 
taken some steps towards incorporating sustainability with wording to guide people to make more sustainable choices and an evaluation of the sustainability of the Eatwell Guide carried out after its development. Also, plant-based foods are given more prominence, which are more healthy and more sustainable. (Atherton & Head, 2016).
There is considerable evidence showing an 
increase in ethical, sustainable and healthy food purchases by consumers (Defra, 2010; FSA, 2019b, 2019a; WRAP , 2015). Survey data shows that sales of ‘socially responsible’ produce

2007, despite the economic downturn, and in 2017 represented 11 per cent of all household food sales (Defra, 2019; Price et al., 2016).
