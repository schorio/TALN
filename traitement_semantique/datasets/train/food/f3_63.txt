Food consumption in the UK
increasing demands among consumers that 
the preparation of food is convenient and saves time (Blow et al., 2019; Howse et al., 2018; Jilcott Pitts et al., 2018, 2018; Rekhy & McConchie, 2014). Time and convenience (i.e. 
food perceived to be ‘quick’ and ‘easy’ to cook) are important drivers of consumption choices (Appleton, 2016; Howse et al., 2018; Jilcott Pitts et al., 2018), particularly for lower-income individuals who often lack time (Howse et al., 2018). Lack of cooking skills and/or confidence can also affect consumption, as people that are less confident or able are more likely to consume processed/unhealthy foods (Lam & Adams, 2017; Sprake et al., 2018) and less able to eat diversely (K. H. Ng et al., 2015). However, this evidence tends to come from cross-sectional studies and it is not clear whether educational interventions could be effective in addressing these challenges. 
Changes in personal and social 
circumstances can change practices and affect consumption patterns
There is some evidence that changes to 
diet are found to happen following social shocks such as divorce, separation, becoming widowed, moving house or having children (O’Neill et al., 2019; Rekhy & McConchie, 2014; Vinther et al., 2016). This can reflect sense of responsibility (e.g. providing ‘proper’ food for your family) but also exposure to new ideas, for example children bringing new practices, like vegetarianism, into the home (O’Neill et al., 2019), or changes in available income (Thomas et al., 2019). However, there is strong evidence that suggests that changes in personal and social circumstance interact with the preferences and taste of consumers to influence their food-related practices (Bailey et al., 2015; Garnett et al., 2015; Kamar et al., 
32 Segmentation analysis involves dividing consumers into homogeneous gr oups or ‘segments’, which are assumed to 
behave in the same way (C. Barnett & Mahony, 2011).2016; Konttinen et al., n.d.; Stephens et al., 2018; Which?, 2013; Wills et al., 2019) . The 
extent to which individuals can make choices based on their preferences depends on their social and personal circumstances, and interrelated factors such as availability and accessibility, cost and convenience, the wider food architecture, and advertisements and educational campaigns (Apostolidis & McLeay, 
2019; Kamar et al., 2016; Stephens et al., 2018; Wills et al., 2019).
Given the differences between 
individuals, segmentation approaches can be useful in analysing consumption practices, but the groupings are typically context specific
Reflecting the wide range of different attitudes 
and practices across the population, many studies look to divide the population into groups to analyse their consumption practices, which can provide useful insights. Studies use a diverse range of segmentation approaches
32. 
The vast majority of these are based on either practices or attitudes depending on the nature and focus of the study (Apostolidis & McLeay, 2019; Font i Furnols et al., 2011; Hardcastle et al., 2015; Shareck et al., 2018). For example, one study investigated three clusters – meat eaters, meat reducers and vegetarians – and their preference for meat and meat substitutes (Apostolidis & McLeay, 2019). Another study looked at three clusters of eating behaviours, ‘impulsive involved’, ‘uninvolved’, and ‘rational, health conscious’, and their association with consumption of unhealthy food (Hardcastle et al., 2015).
