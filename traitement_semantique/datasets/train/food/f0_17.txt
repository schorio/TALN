Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE 
Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after 
surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements
The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo -
gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 
60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of 
meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg -
nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below:
• Children: 30 –50 g (half a palm of meat)
• Teenagers: 60 –75 g (a palm of meat)
• Adults: 60 –70 g (a palm of meat)
• Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat)
Fats and oils
Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant 
sources.
Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of 
infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease.
Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. 
These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.
