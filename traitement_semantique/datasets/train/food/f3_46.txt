The underlying drivers of trends and patterns in 
consumer food practices and preferences are complex. A range of diverse and interconnected factors shape and influence the actions and decisions that individuals take within particular food environments as well as the wider food system. By considering the influence of social practices, cost, availability and access to information and marketing, as well as the role of industry and government and the importance of food quality and safety, it is possible to understand the diverse and complex system in which consumer practices and preferences to food are shaped. Figure 7 provides an overview 
of the drivers that the literature highlights are important and their relative importance. The drivers at the top of the triangle are those that have high-quality evidence and are perceived as consistently important in the literature, while the drivers at the bottom are those that have the least evidence to support their importance in the literature.
There is strong evidence that 
the cost of food is an important predictor of food purchases
There is strong evidence that the cost of food 
has an effect on consumer purchases, with increasing cost decreasing the likelihood of consuming certain food products (Akaichi et al., 2016; Appleton et al., 2017; Edwards et al., 2010; European Food Safety Authority, 2019; Howse et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018; Stephens et al., 2018; Vinther et al., 2016). Consumer choices are driven by the perceived affordability of certain food products (Appleton et al., 2017), price (Akaichi et al., 2016; Apostolidis & McLeay, 2019; Edwards et al., 2010; Font i Furnols et al., 2011; Ghvanidze et al., 2017; Howse et al., 2018; Revoredo-Giha et al., 2018; Stephens et al., 2018) and perceived value for money (Blow et al., 2019; Bondy & Talwar, 2011; Griffith et al., 2015). 
Costs shape what people can afford to eat, 
the healthiness of their food choices and the willingness to consume ‘socially responsible’ food products. Food prices shape where people eat and whether they eat in the home or outside of it (Appleton, 2016). The perception that healthier choices are more expensive is a major barrier to making healthier decisions about food (An, 2013; Griffith et al., 2015; Howse et al., 2018; Pechey & Monsivais, 2016). The price of food influences consumers’ willingness to purchase Fairtrade and organic products (An, 2013; Bondy & Talwar, 2011; Jensen et al., 2011). Costs also shape the consumption of meat and meat replacements. Studies have cited cost as driving the frequency of meat consumption, the willingness to consume meat substitutes, as well as consumption of vegetarian products, with a lower price preferred (Akaichi et al., 2016; Appleton, 2016; Font i Furnols et al., 2011). Although cost is a major barrier to the Drivers of consumption – what 
influences food consumption practices? 3
