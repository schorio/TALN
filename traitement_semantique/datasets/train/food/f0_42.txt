Body building foods “GROW” (proteins)
The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, 
fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important 
to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with 
four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also 
be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes.
Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to 
some extent rabbits.
Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use 
much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, 
common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the 
plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.
Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in 
protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from 
plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality.
Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as 
possible, it must be put in place for families to access it.
Protective foods “GLOW” (vitamins and minerals)
Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at 
least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe 
apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). 
Citrus fruits are very good but we don’t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well. Two guavas per day can be very healthy.
