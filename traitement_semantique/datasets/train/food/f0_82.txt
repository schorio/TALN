Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers71Summary 	of	common	agricultural 	projects	or	actions	linked	to	
nutrition
• Backyard gardens for fruits, vegetable and herbs strategically placed 
near the home to enable easy watering using waste water during 
the dry season (picture 18).
• Rearing of small animal and birds such as poultry, fish, goats, pigs, 
guinea pigs and rabbits that can be reared in the backyard.
• Rearing local chickens are quite easy to keep by both women and children. They multiply very fast, supply high quality protein, have a good market potential and can be kept both for household nutrition 
and income generation.
• The kroiller birds adapted from India have both the characteris-
tics of the local chicken and the modern poultry breeds (picture 
18).
• Rabbits are very good for nutrition improvement. They multiply 
very fast, supply high quality body building foods and can easily 
be reared by children (picture 18).
• Zero grazing dairy enterprises especially under women groups.
• Built-in food safety nets actions that reduce risks.
• Household food processing and preservation technologies that 
increase availability, access, security and utilization of most deficient 
nutrients.
• Integrating gender and child care considerations in agricultural pro-
gram design and implementation.
• Encouraging the production, consumption and marketing of staple foods with high nutrition value, e.g., orange fleshed sweet potatoes, 
iron rich beans, soy beans, foods fortified with micronutrient, e.g., 
vitamin A fortified oil, vitamin A fortified flour and iron fortified 
flour.
• Giving special considerations for the participation and benefits 
access to vulnerable people such people living and affected by HIV/
AIDS, diabetes, cancer, infants, pregnant and lactating women, chil -
dren, the sick, the elderly, the displaced and the poor.
• Integrating nutrition education into agricultural extension programs.
