Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers59• Clean and sort to remove broken kernels, foreign matter, and diseased 
and rotten foods (grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables); these attract mois -
ture and pests leading to spoilage and/or fungal growth.
• Ensure crops are properly dried immediately after harvesting; howev -
er, drying will not reverse the effect of poison in the already contam-
inated foods, but it may inhibit further growth of moulds and other 
microbes.
Promote	good	storage	practices	to	protect	the	nutrient	content	
of the foods
• Proper storage spaces should have clear pathways to allow good air -
flow; ensure timely pest control interventions; ensure that grains are 
bagged in natural fibre bags for storage (not plastic). Improved storage 
and storage techniques can increase availability of nutritious foods 
during the lean season, reduce food safety concerns such as aflatoxin 
and increase marketability and trade in nutritious foods.
Distribution 	
• Distribution should also ensure that risks of contamination are re -
duced. For example, containers should be clean and dry.
Household 	agroprocessing 	and	value	addition
• Household or on-farm processing gives food security and nutrition benefits in addition to higher, potentially stable and regular incomes.
• Simple/hand coffee processing tools will ensure that coffee husks remain and act as manure for crop enterprises.
• Many foods that are transported to the urban centres and other markets in their very fresh forms result in considerable soil nutrient 
mining of the production areas and burdening of the waste disposal 
systems in the target markets. A case in point is the banana market in 
Uganda.
KEY MESSAGE 
Promote household/cottage level agriculture value addition for better 
incomes and as part of sustainable agricultural production systems for improving food security and nutrition.
