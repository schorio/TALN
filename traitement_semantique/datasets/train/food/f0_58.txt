Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers47Proper refuse disposal
Wastes and kitchen refuse should not be littered everywhere in the 
compound lest flies will be invited.
• Use a garbage bin/pit for the disposal of wastes generated in the 
home.
• A compost pit should be dug in the kitchen’s vicinity to accommo-date kitchen and house refuse.
• Garbage should be burnt or buried in garbage pits to avoid breeding grounds of pests and rodents.
• Before disposal to the compost pit nondegradable garbage such as polythene bags should be separated out and preferably recycled in 
the appropriate facility.
• Compost manure from these pits can be used for agricultural pur -
poses to improve soil fertility. This in turn is nutrition advantageous.
Sanitation
• Children are particularly susceptible to contracting diarrhoea when 
any faecal matter is presenting the environment and may lead to 
malnutrition.
• Safe handling and disposal of faeces can reduce the risk of diar -
rhoea disease.
• Latrine should be located at least 6 meters away from the main 
house and routinely maintained and roofed:
• Kept clean and free from flies by routine sweeping and smoking, or by applying used car oil.
• Have a door and a cover for the latrine hole. Improved latrines, e.g., Ventilated Improved Pit (VIP) latrines are recommended.
