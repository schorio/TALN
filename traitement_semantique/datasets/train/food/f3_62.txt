feeling guilt about their consumption decisions 
(e.g. consuming takeaway meals) (Blow et al., 2019) and moralising certain types of foods (e.g. snack food being construed negatively or healthy food being described as ‘sensible’) (Stephens et al., 2018) and associating others with aspects of their identity (e.g. masculinity) (Stephens et al., 2018).  
Mental health can also be a driver of 
consumption. Adults with low levels of well-being, high stress or depression tend to eat less well (Devonport et al., 2019; Russell et al., 2016), and childhood abuse is associated with being obese as an adult (Hemmingsson et al., 2014; Russell et al., 2016). 
Habits are an important driver of consumption 
(Blow et al., 2019; de Ridder et al., 2017; K. H. Ng et al., 2015; Rekhy & McConchie, 2014) and can be difficult to change (Gardner et al., 2011). Habit strength and level of self-regulation will vary between individuals, which will influence their ability to be able to make the food choices they would rationally wish to – for example, to eat more healthily (de Ridder et al., 2017; McDermott et al., 2015; Sleddens et al., 2015). Beyond this, people have to want to change what they eat. Self-regulation strategies in which people control their food intake and change eating patterns are effective only when people want to and are planning to change their eating practices (de Ridder et al., 2017; Sleddens et al., 2015). Although people tend to struggle to prioritise long-term benefits over short-term pleasure, long-term gains are the focus of most healthy eating messages (Evans et al., 2017). 
Cultural and social norms can 
influence eating behaviours
There is some high-quality evidence that 
cultural and social norms can influence eating practices (Köster & Mojet, 2015; Skeer et al., 2016) and are established early in life. Ethnic differences in dietary intake are seen as early as 12 months (Sahota et al., 2016) and children copy what parents eat. Lack of knowledge, time and money can affect parents’ ability to change their own consumption patterns (Mazarello Paes et al., 2015; Rekhy & McConchie, 2014). Social norms are also ingrained and can be hard to change; for example, people eat larger portions on larger plates due to the social norm of ‘cleaning one’s plate’ (Chandon, 2013). 
Individual and social factors 
interact with contextual factors 
Wider socio-economic changes and 
events can impact on personal values and norms
Individuals do not behave in isolation when 
making food choices. Socio-economic and environmental context can influence an individuals’ ability to exercise choice (Mansfield & Savaiano, 2017), and can also affect values and norms and how these govern behaviour (Hardcastle et al., 2015; Puelles et al., 2016). Economic shocks can also drive changes in consumption. For example, during economic crisis, consumers are more likely to use discount supermarkets and exercise more conscious decision making around price, control and time spent shopping (Puelles et al., 2016). Similarly, one-off events, such as the horsemeat scandal, can affect consumer levels of trust in labelling and information as a whole, having impacts on consumption decisions (J. Barnett et al., 2016). Trustworthiness of food providers is an important driver for consumption for many individuals (J. Barnett et al., 2016; Garnett et al., 2015; Happer & Wellesley, 2019; Jackson, 2010; Jensen et al., 2011; Price et al., 2016; Spencer et al., 2014) . 
Time and resources are also important 
contextual factors for consumers
As the pace of life and daily routine has
