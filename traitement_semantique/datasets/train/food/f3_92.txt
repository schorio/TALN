A ‘whole systems’ approach is needed to 
change food consumption 
Taken together, the evidence suggests 
that a combination of coordinated and complementary approaches across the spectrum of policy categories is likely to be most effective at changing consumer diets and related practices rather than isolated interventions (Apostolidis & McLeay, 2016; de Bakker & Dagevos, 2012; Mozaffarian et al., 2012; Nederkoorn et al., 2011). There is a myriad of complex and interacting drivers Box 7 Summary of key evidence gaps in the existing literature (continued)
Interventions
• Many evaluations of the effectiveness of interventions are limited to short-term or 
intermediate outcomes, which limits their usefulness. Examples include evaluation of healthy eating campaigns, which often look at changes in attitudes or knowledge rather than consumption; and evaluations of workplace well-being initiatives, which often have a poor evaluation design, small sample sizes and only short-term follow-up. More long-term evaluations looking at ultimate intended outcomes are needed. More generally, the quality of evaluations could be improved.
• Interventions aiming to change information availability, either through healthy eating campaigns or restriction of advertising, often focus on traditional media and do not target new media. This may limit their effectiveness and makes it difficult to establish whether these types of interventions could work if they were more comprehensive.
• Most evidence on interventions is focused on health outcomes rather than other types of consumption behaviours (e.g. more sustainable or ethical consumption). 
• There is some suggestion that studies in real-world settings may show different effects on consumption than in experimental settings, typically with smaller effects seen in a real-world context. More real-world data is therefore needed. Examples here include provision of calorie information in food outlets and changes in food pricing.
• There is very limited evidence on the effect of changes in the food available in settings such as hospitals or food delivered at home to low-income, older people. Given that changes in provision in schools and, to a lesser extent, workplace settings have an effect on consumption, this merits further investigation. 
• There is very limited evidence on the impact of policies aiming to regulate or change the environment in terms of density or prevalence of fast-food outlets or to address food deserts. There is a strong association between obesity and access to unhealthy food, for example through a high concentration of unhealthy fast-food outlets. However, many studies are cross-sectional so the direction of causality is unclear, and the correlation may be mediated by socio-economic status and educational attainment. This needs to be better understood to support effective policy development. There are also no examples of evaluations or reported implementation of policy interventions addressing the built food environment in the academic literature, which is an important gap.
