Nopales
Opuntia 12
Also known as the prickly pear or cactus pear, 
nopales are easy to grow and highly adaptive. 
They are widely cultivated in Central and 
South America, Africa and the Middle East, 
and are beginning to increase in popularity in 
Australia and Europe. 
The fruit, flower, cladodes (flattened shoots 
rising from the stem of the plant) and oil of  
the nopal cactus are rich sources of nutrients, 
but they are not only valuable crops from a 
nutrition perspective. They also have potential 
for use as an alternative animal feed and to 
produce biogas23 (a renewable energy source).Some clinical studies suggest that nopales 
can even help with weight loss,24  due to their 
low calorie and high fibre content, but the 
benefits are yet to be proven. They have also 
undergone trials with results suggesting that 
they could help relieve symptoms of alchohol-
induced hangovers25. This is likely due to their 
nutrient and water content.
Nopales are a common ingredient in Mexican 
cuisine; the leaves and flowers can be eaten 
raw, cooked, or made into delicious juices  
or jams.
