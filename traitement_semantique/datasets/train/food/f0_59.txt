A clean, organized home environment prevents us from diseases, keeps us comfortable and adds beauty and scenic appeal to our homes. When diseases occur, they directly and negatively affect the nutritional status of a person no matter how well fed he/she was. It is possible to attain good standards of hygiene and sanitation regardless of where we live and under what conditions we live in. By maintaining a clean environ -
ment through practicing proper sanitation and hygiene, we prevent many infections and therefore save on resources (money, energy and time for treatment). Prevention is better than cure:
• Ensure good personal hygiene by regularly bathing, washing your 
clothes, trimming hair and nails.
• The home surrounding should be kept clean by:
• Sweeping the compound every day.
• Keeping grass low.
• Draining all stagnant water around the house to keep away the mosquitoes.
• Building animal houses.
