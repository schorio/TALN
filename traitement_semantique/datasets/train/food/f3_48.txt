Costs are also relative to income level and, in 
many instances, income differences explain a lot of the observed dietary health differences (Appleton et al., 2017; Barton et al., 2015; Bondy & Talwar, 2011; Cribb et al., 2011; Edwards et al., 2010; Hawkesworth et al., 2017; Levin, 2014; Palma et al., 2017; Pearson et al., 2018; Pechey & Monsivais, 2016; Rekhy & McConchie, 2014; Thomas et al., 2019; Townshend & Lake, 2017). Food products that are more expensive and have higher-quality health outcomes are associated with more consumption in higher income groups (Darmon & Drewnowski, 2015). There is also some evidence that changes in relative prices drive households’ decisions to change the quantities of the different food groups that they buy (Griffith et al., 2015). In general, those in low-income groups often have less expensive food expenditure practices, consume less healthy food and less fruits and vegetables (Appleton, 2016; Barton et al., 2015; de Ridder et al., 2017; Hawkesworth et al., 2017; Levin, 2014; Levin et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2019; Townshend & Lake, 2017; Whybrow et al., 2018).
Marketing and advertising have 
a significant effect on food purchases, especially for children and young people
There is strong evidence that consumer 
choices are significantly influenced by marketing and advertising (Buchanan et al., 2018; Cairns et al., 2009; Kamar et al., 2016; Kavallari et al., 2011; Kearney, 2010; Roberto et al., 2015; Saltmarsh, 2014; Vinther et al., 2016; 
20 Food advertising, marketing and food promotion is used interchangeably in the literature (Buchanan et al., 2018; 
Cairns et al., 2009; Griffith et al., 2018; Kamar et al., 2016).
21 Unhealthy foods are defined as crisps, confectionary, junk food and sugary drinks.
22 Although health and nutrition claims are typically aimed at an adult audience, they are also commonly found in 
advertising to children and emerging evidence suggests that children are influenced by this information (Dixon et al., 
2014).Wills et al., 2019).20 Marketing and advertising 
increases the consumption of unhealthy foods 
in children (Cairns et al., 2009; Chambers et al., 2015), adolescents (Kamar et al., 2016) and young adults (Buchanan et al., 2018) . In 
addition, a significant amount of money is spent by food companies on marketing each year, with the companies producing the top 18 brands in the UK spending more than £143 million in 2016 on marketing unhealthy foods (O’Dowd, 2017).

In particular, there is some high-quality evidence around the negative impacts of advertising has on children and young people (Buchanan et al., 2018; Griffith et al., 2015; MacGregor & Bicquelet, 2016). For example, each additional hour of commercial TV that children in the UK watch is associated with a 27 per cent increased likelihood of buying unhealthy food and drink (Boyland et al., 2018). A systematic review found that the most persuasive marketing techniques for children are premium offers, the use of promotional characters, nutritional and health claims,
22 the 
theme of taste and the emotional appeal of fun (Jenkin, Madhvani, Signal, & Bowers, 2014; Buchanan et al., 2018).
Particular forms of marketing and advertising 
are also cited to be more effective. For example, digital marketing has a strong positive association with unhealthy energy drink consumption for young people (Buchanan et al., 2018) and media narratives can help endorse and challenge established notions about food (Happer & Wellesley, 2019; MacGregor & Bicquelet, 2016). While the impact of traditional media (i.e. television, radio, newspapers) on
