What we eat has big implications for our 
health, our society and the environment. Understanding these trends, what drives them and how we can change consumption practices through interventions is crucial to inform policy. This report provides a review of consumer attitudes and practices to food in the UK in support of the work of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) on food production and consumption. The review presents evidence on: (1) the main trends related to consumer food practices and attitudes; (2) the drivers of consumption (e.g. the role of information or food system actors); (3) interventions that can influence food consumption practices; and (4) personal differences between groups, or ‘food publics’, across the trends, drivers and interventions. The report provides a summary of the existing evidence and gaps in the evidence. The study was commissioned by the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) and was delivered by RAND Europe.
