Food consumption in the UK
Table 1 Summary of interventions to change food consumption and evidence of their effectiveness 
Intervention Effectiveness Strength of evidence Comments and caveats Key sourcesKnowledge
 and informationSchool education Moderate–high Moderate–high Interactive/experiential learning is most effectiveJepson et al., 2010; Muzaffar et al., 2018; Rekhy & 
McConchie, 2014; Dudley et al., 2015
Education in healthcare setting Moderate Moderate–highOnline approaches are likely less effective than phone/in personJepson et al., 2010; Kelly et al., 2016; Harris et al., 2011
Mass media campaigns Low–moderate Low–moderateLimitations to campaign design (e.g. TV only, not online) – better designed campaigns might be more effectiveAfshin et al., 2015; Kite et al., 2018; Wakefield et al., 2010
Labelling in supermarkets Low–moderate Moderate but mixedTraffic light approaches are more effective than just information provisionAfshin et al., 2015; Campos, Doxey, & Hammond, 2011; Cecchini & Warin, 2016; Shangguan Siyi et al., 2015
Labelling in restaurants/fast-food settingsLow Moderate but mixed More studies needed in real-world settings(Littlewood et al., 2016; Magnusson, 2010; Wright & Bragge, 2018; Long et al., 2015; Sinclair et al., 2014
Advertising regulation Unclear but likely moderate LowLimitations in both evaluation and policy design limit our knowledge of effectivenessAfshin et al., 2015; Chambers et al., 2015; Galbraith-Emami & Lobstein, 2013; Mills et al., 2013Food environmentFood provision in schools Moderate–high Moderate–highMandatory approaches most effective; combining with education approaches also effectiveCoyle et al., 2009; Evans et al., 2012; Afshin et al., 2015; Niebylski et al., 2014
Worksite well-being Low Moderate–highMain effect is on fruit and vegetable intake, more limited evidence on other outcomes; significant variability in intervention design limits generalisabilityAfshin et al., 2015; Geaney et al., 2013; Gudzune et al., 2013; Jepson et al., 2010; Niebylski et al., 2014; Schliemann & Woodside, 2019
Micro environment – placement, portion sizeLow–moderate Low–moderate but mixedEffectiveness likely depends on context; acceptability of ‘nudges’ to public also a concernBucher et al., 2016; Cadario & Chandon, 2019; Hartmann-Boyce et al., 2018; Hollands et al., 2015; Houghtaling et al., 2019
Food provision in other public settingsUnclear Low Very little evidence identified Niebylski et al., 2014
Built food environment Unclear but likely moderate LowNo evidence of policy implementation and evaluation identifiedAfshin et al., 2015; Beaulac et al., 2009; Cobb et al., 2015; Fleischhacker et al., 2011Cost and 
content of foodTaxes, subsidies and price changesLow–moderate Moderate Understanding of substitution effects limited Afshin et al., 2017; Eyles et al., 2012; Hartmann-Boyce et al., 2018; Ng et al., 2012; Niebylski et al., 2014; Thow et al., 2010; Andreyeva et al., 2010; Niebylski et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2018; Wright et al., 2017
Reformulation of food Moderate ModerateSubstitution effects unclear; can be driven by other changes (price changes, labelling requirements)Federici et al., 2019; Grieger et al., 2017; Hashem et al., 2019
Source: RAND Europe analysis. All target participants are adults (19 years old and above) and children (up to 18 years old), except for interventions in schools that target children only. Depth of shading of the rows provides an indication of the most promising (darker) and least promising (lighter) interventions based on the current evidence. ‘Effectiveness’ is defined as the ability to achieve the desired behaviour changes, i.e. to reduce food consumption or otherwise change dietary behaviours and/or increase awareness or knowledge related to healthy/sustainable food consumption.
