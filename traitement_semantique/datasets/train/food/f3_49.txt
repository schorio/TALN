Food consumption in the UK
food consumption also relies on whether media 
narratives align with existing beliefs, there is strong evidence that traditional media can create uncertainty about established narratives by, for example, making consumers doubt the scientific basis for the environmental benefits of a vegetarian diet (Happer & Wellesley, 2019). There is also some emerging, albeit weaker, evidence in the grey literature that the role of television is increasingly being replaced by social media, particularly for younger segments of the population (i.e. millennials and subsequent generations), as youth are influenced by social media behaviours and the sharing culture around food, for example on Instagram (wbcsd, 2018).
However, while marketing and advertising 
have some effect, it is difficult to isolate the effects on specific diet-related practices. The effectiveness of marketing and advertising campaigns for certain segments of the population depends on other factors such as the political and socio-economic context in which marketing operates, accessibility and availability of food, meal patterns, as well as packaging, product design and price (Buchanan et al., 2018; Cairns et al., 2009; MacGregor & Bicquelet, 2016; Webb & Byrd-Bredbenner, 2015). Peoples’ purchasing decisions depend on knowledge and prior experience; for example, marketing effects tend to be stronger for unfamiliar brands and products (Chandon, 2013). 
The scope for consumers to 
make decisions in a given food environment depends on availability and convenience of food and food outlets 
There is strong evidence that food-related 
decisions in certain environments depend on the availability and convenience of food and food outlets (Appleton, 2016; Cook et al., 2015; Howse et al., 2018; Jensen et al., 2011; Kamar et al., 2016; Moore et al., 2010; Paddock et al., 2017; Roberto et al., 2015; Stephens et al., 2018; Townshend & Lake, 2017; Vinther et al., 2016; Walmsley et al., 2018). For example, consumers are more likely to increase their consumption of certain food types (such as meat, fruit and eggs) if they perceive that it is convenient (Appleton, 2016) and easily accessible in supermarkets and convenience stores (Howse et al., 2018; Jensen et al., 2011; Kamar et al., 2016; Walmsley et al., 2018), in the home (Cook, O’Reilly, DeRosa, Rohrbach, & Spruijt-Metz, 2015; Stephens et al., 2018), at work or in schools (Kamar et al., 2016; Stephens et al., 2018) or in local neighbourhoods (Paddock et al., 2017; Stephens et al., 2018; Townshend & Lake, 2017).  
The availability of certain foods in environments 
frequently visited by consumers also influences consumption. In particular, the presence of relatively cheaper and unhealthy food increases their consumption and hence the quality of people’s diets (Griffith et al., 2015; Mansfield & Savaiano, 2017; Moore et al., 2010; Roberto et al., 2015; Townshend & Lake, 2017, Stephens et al., 2018). For example, school environments facilitate healthy food choices if healthy options are readily available and promoted within the school environment (Mansfield & Savaiano, 2017). This also applies to supermarkets and other food outlets, where the availability of healthy choices in supermarkets and the general availability of different food outlets have an influence on healthy food choices (Marshall et al., 2018; Stephens et al., 2018; Walmsley et al., 2018; Xin et al., 2019), although this might differ based on whether the food outlet is online or offline. For example, the convenience of online ordering and home delivery is a major factor affecting consumers’ decision to purchase organic box schemes (Hashem et al., 2018; Jilcott Pitts et al., 2018; Munson et al., 2017) and in general, availability is an important driver
