Food consumption in the UK
However, research from Mintel, a market 
research organisation, suggests that over the last five years, sales of ethical food and drink
18 
have increased by 43 per cent from £5.7 billion in 2013 to £8.2 billion in 2018 (Mintel, 2019a). The consumption of plant-based meals in particular is on the rise, and consumption has grown by 
37 per cent  in the last four years 
(Kantar, 2019). There has been a particular increase in ‘flexitarian’ or semi-vegetarian diets (George, 2019; Mintel, 2019b), which according to one survey make up just over 9 per cent of the UK population (George 2019). There is some evidence on socio-demographic characteristics suggesting that environmentally sustainable consumers tend to be female and younger (Latvala et al., 2012; Su et al., 2019; WRAP , 2015; YouGov: Eating Better, 2019), whereas the consumption of ethically-certified food is driven by older consumers (aged 55 or more) (Mintel, 2019a).  
There is also some evidence for 
changes to various other consumer values (such as food provenance and safety), although this may depend on the food group. 
In general, some consumers would like more 
locally produced food (e.g. British food) (FSA, 2019a), with one survey showing that 59 per cent of shoppers agree that they try to buy British food whenever they can (Defra, 2019). Some consumers may also prefer shorter supply chains, although the evidence around this is less clear and may be linked to one-off events such as the 2013 horsemeat scandal, which served to highlight the length and complexity of food chains (J. Barnett et 
18 This includes for example: organic, Fairtr ade, Rainforest Alliance and Marine Stewardship Council certified products.
19 The ‘value-action gap’ refers to gaps seen between stated consumer v alues and preferences and consumption 
practices (Carrigan, 2017; Hassan et al., 2016).al., 2016). There is also some evidence that some consumers prefer less processing and are cautious around novel food technologies for food processing, particularly around meat production, having a negative perception of the production and processing of beef products (W. Verbeke et al., 2010). Consumers’ acceptance of novel food technologies such as nanotechnologies varies greatly depending on their awareness but also general attitude towards new technologies, with some evidence suggesting that consumers may have greater acceptance for applications that are not ingested such as smart packaging (Santeramo et al., 2018). Some consumers are also concerned about food safety specifically when it comes to meat consumption, although this may also be linked to meat-related food scares, which are often short term and related to political events (Font-i-Furnols & Guerrero, 2014). For example, events such as the bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis in the UK in the 1990s and more recently the debate on chlorinated chicken following the UK’s exit from the European Union, can serve to highlight food production in the public debate for a few years (Food Safety News, 2019; Murray, 2018). 
However, consumers typically demonstrate 
a ‘value-action gap’,
19 in that while certain 
individuals increasingly state sustainable and ethical preferences, this often only translates into actual practices if other needs are satisfied (e.g. price, availability and quality) (Apostolidis & McLeay, 2016; Bondy & Talwar, 2011; IGD, 2019a; W. Verbeke et al., 2010). For example, a study of 3,000 UK households found that although a range of issues (such as animal welfare, ethical production and sustainability) were rated as important by a high percentage of households, the percentage claiming to
