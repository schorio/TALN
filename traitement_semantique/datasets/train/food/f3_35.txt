Food consumption in the UK
and cultures in which people operate make 
it increasingly difficult to make healthy and sustainable food choices. Many actors, including the government and the food industry, contribute to the food environment, and they all have a role to play in promoting healthy and sustainable diets by making healthy food choices easier to access and more appealing (WHO, 2020).  Figure 5 illustrates the complex 
and interconnected elements of the food system as well as the network of different groups with a stake in the food system.
Food is big business. The agri-food sector 
contributed £121 billion (9.4 per cent) to UK national gross value added in 2018 (Defra, 2019). However, the food industry landscape in the UK is changing. For example, consumers are increasingly buying online and eating out of home (Dablanc et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2018). In addition, the availability of food is also increasing with growing global supply chains and technological progress (Dablanc et al., 2017; FAO, 2018). Upcoming opportunities and events such as new technologies (e.g. novel foods, automation), changing consumer practices (e.g. sustainable and ethical concerns), political and other factors (e.g. the UK’s exit from the European Union, antimicrobial resistance) also provide potential opportunities and challenges, with uncertain implications for UK food consumption patterns (Elta Smith et al., 2019).
Some individuals are changing too, as 
many have different attitudes to food and a range of values that guide food choices. For example, there is a growing concern about the environment among young people and some individuals are increasingly eating less meat (YouGov: Eating Better, 2019). These different
