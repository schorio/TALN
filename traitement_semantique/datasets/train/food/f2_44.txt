Sprouting dates back 5,000 years when Chinese physicians 
used sprouts medicinally because of their extremely high 
nutrient content. The sprouting process doubles, and 
in some cases triples, the nutritional value of the plant. 
Seeds and beans need warm and humid conditions to 
sprout, therefore they carry the risk of bacterial growth. 
They feature in the Future 50 Foods list because experts 
agree that, for healthy people, the added nutritional value 
outweighs the potential risks that can be associated with 
them*. Sprouts are delicious as a side dish topped with a 
light dressing or in soups, salads and sandwiches to add a 
nice crunchy texture. 
*If sprouting at home, food safety practices and directions need to be followed.  
Always wash sprouts thoroughly with cold water and avoid any rotten pieces or parts.
