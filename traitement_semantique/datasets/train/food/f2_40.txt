40According to Assyrian legend, when the 
gods met to create the world, they drank 
wine made from sesame seeds. Cultivated 
for millennia and highly resilient47, the plants 
produce pods that burst open when mature to 
reveal their tiny golden seeds. This is where the 
phrase ‘open sesame’ comes from. 
These seeds have a high oil content and are 
considered an excellent source of copper and 
magnesium48. They can be eaten raw, toasted and as a paste called tahini. They add crunch 
and a nice nutty flavour to sushi, salads, soups, 
noodle and rice dishes. They’re commonly 
found in crackers and baked goods, such as 
the Middle Eastern dessert halva.
They also make a wonderfully fragrant oil  
that is great in stir-fries, drizzled over savoury 
dishes and in dressings. 
Possibly the oldest tree food known to humans, 
records report walnut consumption dating back 
10,000 years49. Containing more omega 3 fatty 
acids and vitamin E than many other nuts, the 
kernel itself resembles the two halves of a brain, 
reinforcing their nickname of ‘brain food’.
Walnuts contain protein, vitamins and minerals, 
and have been claimed to be one of the most 
nutritious nuts. Slightly bittersweet with an oily 
texture, they may be pickled when young or‘wet’. However, they are more commonly eaten 
dried, either raw or cooked in both sweet and 
savoury dishes such as cakes, muesli, stews, 
sauces and dressings. Dry-frying or roasting 
turns them a lovely gold and really brings out 
their flavour.
Grown in China, Turkey, Iran, Mexico and the 
US, walnuts fare best in rich, deep soil and 
sunny climates and grow all year round.Category Nuts & Seeds
