“Demand for a wider variety of crops could provide 
more farmers in developing countries with a boost 
in income. If handled carefully, with safeguards 
against potential environmental, social and 
economic risks, it could mean they can send their 
children to school instead of to work, can invest 
in the farm and become more financially secure - 
the whole local economy could benefit.”
