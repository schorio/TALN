Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) 
produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans.

and continue throughout the food value chain. Control 
strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and 
postharvest management practices.
