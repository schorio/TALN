Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers7Fat/lipid/oil requirements
Fat provides high amounts of energy to the body; 1 g of fat produces over 
9 kcals.
Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake 
of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg.
Sources of fats/lipids/oils
• Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, 
lard, milk, and egg yolk. 
• Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil.
KEY MESSAGES 
• Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart 
disease.
• Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and 
adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re -
placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease.
Dietary fibre
This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible 
portion of the food.
Dietary fibre increases the body’s sense of satisfaction thus preventing 
overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body’s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch.
Main sources of dietary fibre
• Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran.
• Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and 
pumpkin leaves.
