Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers27SUMMARY
• Malnutrition can be undernutrition or overnutrition.
• Undernutrition includes acute malnutrition, chronic malnutri -
tion and micronutrient deficiencies.
• Undernutrition has immediate causes (inadequate food intake 
and illness), underlying causes (household food insecurity, 
inadequate maternal and child care practices, poor access to 
health, water and sanitation services) and basic causes (sub -
optimal political, economic, and social policies and systems).
• Consequences of malnutrition include increased illness and death, poor growth and development, lower labour produc -
tivity, poorer educational attainment, and noncommunicable disease like diabetes and hypertension.
• Undernutrition occurs across the life cycle and can pass from one generation to another.
• It is important to break this cycle through interventions to promote nutritional status of adolescent girls and women of 
reproductive age and from pregnancy through 24 months of 
age.
