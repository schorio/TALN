Laver is a variety of red algae known for its link to Japanese cuisine. Called ‘nori’ in 
Japan and most commonly used for wrapping sushi, laver is heralded for its  
exceptional nutrient content and ability to bring out the umami flavour in foods. 
Umami is the flavour profile that meat provides and is commonly missed in 
plant-based dishes.
Edible seaweed cultivation has been suggested to be a game-  
changer10 in the food system. Because it lives wildly in the water, laver 
seaweed can be grown and harvested throughout the year and 
does not require pesticides or fertilisers. Laver seaweed is rich in 
vitamin C and iodine11.  
Laver is often consumed dried as a topping for soups and salads. In 
Korea, it is eaten dried as a savoury snack and is referred to as ‘gim’. 
In the UK, especially in Wales, laver is used to make laverbread, 
a dish in which the fresh seaweed is slow-cooked, seasoned and 
traditionally served with hot, buttered toast. Some say people in 
Wales have been eating laver since the first inhabitants arrived; 
others say it was introduced by the Vikings.
