Beet greens
Beta vulgaris 25
Beets have grown in popularity in recent years and are associated with a variety of health 
benefits. However, the leafy green part of the beetroot is the most nutritious part of 
the plant and is often overlooked and left unused. 
With a flavour and nutrition profile similar to that of Swiss chard, beet 
greens are rich in vitamins K and A37. Compared to greens such as turnip 
and mustard greens, beet greens contain higher levels of magnesium 
and potassium. Per serving, beet greens provide up to 25 percent 
of the recommended daily allowance of magnesium, which helps 
regulate a variety of biochemical reactions in the body, including 
muscle and nerve function, blood pressure and blood glucose 
control. Studies in the US and Europe report that around 50 
percent of people get less than the recommended levels of 
magnesium38, 39, 40.
Beet greens also contain as much iron as spinach, plus the plant 
pigment lutein, which is associated with good eye health41. Beet 
plants thrive in cooler temperatures, are tolerant of frost and grow 
at a rapid pace.
They are a nutrition-packed addition to stews, soups and salads. 
With a subtle taste that is similar to kale, beet greens are delicious 
saut√©ed in olive oil or balsamic vinegar for a tasty side dish. 
Developing a soft and sweet taste when cooked, they can even be 
baked to make crisps.
