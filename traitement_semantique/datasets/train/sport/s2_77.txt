If the referee plays advantage following any other red-card offence (which should not usually happen because of the risk of confrontation):
• the red card must be shown when the game next stops or
• if the offender gets involved with the game again, the referee must stop play, award an indirect free kick and send the player off
When a person is sent off, they must leave the surrounds of the pitch (including the bench/technical area) and go straight to the dressing room.
Details about all red cards must be reported after the game to the appropriate disciplinary authorities.
