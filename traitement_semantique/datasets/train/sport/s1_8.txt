chapter  I
inclusive sport – introduction
W    elcome to the Sport and Play For All manual! This manual has been 
based on field experience gained by Handicap International’s Sports For 
All Project in Vavuniya, Sri Lanka. From 2011-2013 the project has been 
working with local authorities, sport officers, sports clubs, schools, children’s clubs, youth clubs and NGOs. The project targeted children and youth with disabilities, and also the wider community. For children and youth with disabilities, the project’s goal was to improve quality of life through sport in terms of physical, psychological and social benefits. For the wider community, the project aimed to increase awareness and understanding about disability, by bringing children and youth out into the open and enabling them to demonstrate their abilities to the public.
The manual also draws upon Handicap International’s wider, global experience, 
in particular in inclusive sports projects in Bangladesh and Tunisia.
