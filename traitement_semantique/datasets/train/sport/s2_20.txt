REQUIREMENTS
There are usually three categories of people named on the team list: players, substitutes and team officials.
The head coach is the senior team official and is responsible for the behaviour of everyone in the technical area, including substitutes, substituted players 
and the other team officials, e.g.
• assistant coaches
• medical staff (doctor, physiotherapist, etc.)
• administrative staff
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN? 
Only team officials named on the team list are allowed on the benches/in the technical area (if there is one).
The team officials must remain on the benches or in the technical area unless permitted to come onto the pitch by the referee, e.g. to assess or 
treat an injured player.
Only one person at a time is allowed to coach.
The referee has authority over the team officials, and they can be shown a red or yellow card for misbehaviour (see: Red cards and Yellow cards.)
WHAT HAPPENS IF…COACHES & OTHER 
TEAM OFFICIALS
