communications between social actors. Social interactionism has been
highly useful in analysing patterns of socialisation, deviancy, stereo-types and stigma. Symbolic interactionism has been the most prominentform of interpretive sociology in the sociology of sport, and absolutely
vital in the investigation of sporting subcultures. Although popular inthe 1970s, and ever present, this particular strand of sociologicalinvestigation has been reinvigorated by the work of the French thinkerPierre Bourdieu. The best examples of published work which adopt asocial interactionist approach would include Scott’s 1968 work onhorse racing, and Polsky’s 1969 investigation of pool hustling.

TASTE
Taste is the aspect of demand most susceptible to inﬂuence by sportspromoters and advertisers. This can be done via product development
andproduct improvement , both of which offer something novel to
the sports consumer, or by attaching characteristics to a sport that change
its public persona. Certainly, both darts and snooker gained large
television audiences when they threw off their pub and club image. Sport,like many other consumer goods, is also susceptible to fads, where tasteis manipulated to render some activities more fashionable than others.
TEACHING FOR UNDERSTANDING
The philosophy of teaching for understanding is founded on theprinciple that the process of learning is equally as important as anyintended outcome or outcomes . The aim is for students to under-
stand what they learn rather than simply perform tasks, and for skillsto be transferable to a range of situations and environments. Thedevelopment of problem-solving and self-discovery in physical edu-cation is designed to increase student participation and interaction,both with other students and with the teacher.
