ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN
The electron transport chain (ETC) is located on the inner
membrane of the mitochondria, and is coupled to the process ofoxidative phosphorylation (or ATP synthesis). This process involves
the movement of reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH formedduring glycolysis and in the Krebs cycle ) along the ETC, where
electrons are stripped from the high-energy hydrogen and these
electrons are then passed to oxygen at the end of the chain to form
water. (Campbell 1996: 170) As electrons are transferred at eachcomplex of the chain, the resulting protons (H+) are pumped intothe inter-membrane space of the mitochondria, thus creating a gra-dient of H+ across the membrane. These H+ complete the circuit byﬂowing down their gradient (known as a proton motive force) backinto the mitochondrial matrix through speciﬁc portals, and this pro-cess in turn provides the energy for the re-phosphorylation of ADP
to ATP . The ETC is regulated by the concentrations of adenine
nucleotides, with ADP and ATP stimulating and inhibiting the chainrespectively.

EMOTION
The impact of emotion on performance and learning in sport andphysical activity is an understudied phenomenon. We have all experi-enced the impact of extreme excitement or fear on our heart rate.Researchers are now beginning to look more closely at the impor-tance of emotion on sport performance through assessing its impacton motivation, attention and concentration and looking at how
adaptive coping can be used to help re-focus emotion. Hanin (2000)
has presented a model entitled Individual Zones of Optimal Functioning(120F) as one possible approach for understanding performance-relatedEMOTION
