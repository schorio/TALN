1.5.6. Cups and saucers
Materials:- 
 Marker saucers, Whistle
How to play
 Scatter marker saucers over a defined area, making sure that half of them are the 
right way up (saucers) and half of them are upside-down (cups). The number of marker saucers you use depends on the size of the playing area and the number of children.
 Divide the children into two equal teams, a ‘cup’ team and a ‘saucer‘ team. 
 On the whistle, the ‘cup’ team have to turn all the saucers into cups and the ‘saucer‘ team has to turn all of the cups into saucers. After a set amount of time (eg. one minute), the whistle is blown again. The winning team is the one with the most cups or saucers.
Adaptations
 Introduce ‘zoning’ in the playing area, where 
marker saucers are closer together in one area to make it easier for children with disabilities.
 Modify the rules, so that, for example, children 
without disabilities can only touch certain coloured marker saucers, while children with disabilities can touch any marker saucer.
1.5.7. The friendly ghost
Materials None 
How to play
 Select one child as the ‘Ghost’ . The other 
children gather behind her.
 The ‘Ghost’ walks and the others follow. After leading them for some distance, the ‘Ghost’ suddenly shouts ‘eeeeeeeh’ and turns and 
chases the children, who 
have to make it back to the starting line without being tagged. 
The first child who is tagged becomes the new ‘Ghost. ’
Adaptations
 Vary the distance of the starting line to make it easier/
more difficult for children according to their abilities.
