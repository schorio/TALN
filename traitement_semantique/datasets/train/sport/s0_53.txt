Nevertheless, perhaps too much critical emphasis can be placed on
the negative aspects of children’s sport. There are coaches who are
trying to improve their qualiﬁcations to teach young persons, andwho set realistic targets for their charges, and there are parents who
want their offspring to enjoy their sport irrespective of the result.

CHOKING
Research suggests that stress management is a very signiﬁcant factor
in successful athletic performance. After a poor performance, athletes
often report having experienced feelings of self-doubt, and when theseself-doubts become so great that they radically affect performance inan adverse manner, athletes refer to this phenomenon as ‘choking’.Numerous theories have been proposed to explain this phenomenon,the most common of which is the inverted-U hypothesis, which holdsthat an optimal or medium level of arousal and stress results in optimalperformance, whereas low or, in the case of choking, very high levels
of stress result in inferior performance. While this theory has intuitive
appeal, critics have suggested that it is inadequate and overly simplis-tic, in that arousal and stress are multifaceted concepts and athletesmay well ‘choke’ for a variety of reasons. Thus alternative theorieshave been posited, including the optimal functioning model, thecatastrophe model, and more recently, a reversal theory model. All ofthese models make contributions to our understanding of choking,but it remains a subject of considerable continuing research interest.
