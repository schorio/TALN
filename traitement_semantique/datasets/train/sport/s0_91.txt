studied at a range of levels from the cellular to the whole body (or
integrative level), in an effort to uncover the body’s responses andadaptations to exercise. Like its parent discipline of physiology,exercise physiology is dependent on and intersects with other dis-
ciplines such as anatomy , biochemistry, biophysics and molecular
biology.

EXTERNALITIES
Participation in sport can confer beneﬁts external to those actually
involved. If sport keeps people healthier, then available health serviceresources can be devoted to treating less preventable disease and
illness. If ﬁtter workers are more productive employees, then both
individual ﬁrms and the economic sector as a whole can gain. Ifsport counteracts delinquency and vandalism, local communities can
proﬁt.

EXTRINSIC MOTIVES
Extrinsic motives are external to an individual and involve seeking
the rewards and beneﬁts of performing a task. Trophies, money andpraise are all forms of extrinsic motivation. The value of extrinsicmotivation to an athlete depends upon the way in which that athleteperceives such motives. If rewards are perceived positively, they canhelp increase intrinsic motivation, but rewards that are viewed as
negative, in that they are designed to control an athlete’s behaviour,
can decrease intrinsic motivation.
