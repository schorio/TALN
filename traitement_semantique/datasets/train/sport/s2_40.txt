The goalkeeper:
• must face the ball
• must be on the goal line and between the goalposts
• must not shake or be touching the goalposts, crossbar or goal net
• can move along the goal line and/or jump up and down, as long as at least part of each foot is on or above the line
• can move off the goal line as the ball is kicked, as long as at least part of one foot is on, above or behind the line
The other goalkeeper must wait on the junction of  the goal line and the penalty area line (on the same side as the assistant referee, if there is one). 
Any of the on-field players may change places with the goalkeeper, as long as the referee is informed.
The kicker:
• must be clearly identified
• can stop and start during their run-up to the ball
• must not stop or feint (pretend to kick the ball) at the end of their run-up – they must kick it immediately
• must kick the ball forward (but can backheel it towards the goal)
• cannot touch the ball again
The referee:
• checks the ball is on the penalty spot and makes sure all players are in the correct position
• blows the whistle for the kick to be taken
• carefully watches the kicker and the goalkeeper (the assistant referee will usually help by watching the goalkeeper and checking whether the 
ball crosses the goal line)
• keeps a record of each kicker (name and/or number), as well as who scores and who misses
The kick is completed when the ball stops moving, goes out of play or the referee stops play for any offence.
