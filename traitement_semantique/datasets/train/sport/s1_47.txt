	Face the child with hearing impairment.
	Reduce background noise/chatter from other children while you are giving 
instructions. In indoor venues echo can be a particular problem, making it difficult for children with hearing impairment to hear you.
	Use gestures, demonstrations, written or pictorial instructions, not just verbal instructions.
For children who know Sign Language, seek interpretation support from a Sign 
Language interpreter if available, or help from a friend or family member who 
understands the child’s gestures and informal signs.
2. visual impairment
	A child with visual impairment is likely to be very cautious and anxious when entering a new environment or when being introduced to a new experience. Therefore ensure plenty of time to explain to the child what you are going to do, and also to explain about the child’s surroundings, eg. verbally describe the playing 
area, how many people are present, etc. Guide the child around the playing area, 
giving a verbal description if necessary.
	When giving instructions, ensure that the 
child with visual impairment is standing at the 
front of the group, where he is more likely to be 
able to see you.
	Use verbal explanation more than visual 
demonstration or visual aids.
	 Ensure that the playing area is well-
marked with clear lines (use bright colours 
where possible).
	 Use modified equipment where 
possible, eg balls with bells, or brightly-
coloured sports equipment. Foam balls and 
beach balls also move more slowly and are easier for the child to track.
	Avoid noisy games that can be very confusing and frightening for a child with visual impairment.
	Make sure that indoor environments (eg. indoor sports halls and games rooms) are well lit.Brightly-coloured, 
tactile play equipment 
such as this is 
specifically designed 
for children with visual 
impairment
