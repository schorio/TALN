BRANDING
The creation of a brand image is important for any business that
hopes to secure repeat sales via customer recognition and apprecia-
tion of its product. This objective did not have much impact on sport
until the advent of merchandising of ofﬁcial club products revealed
a potential important source of revenue, in addition to the more tra-ditional gate receipts and season tickets. Logos now feature on a hostof endorsed products, many of them not at all connected with sport.As clubs increasingly move into non-sports areas of marketing, it islikely that sport branding will shift to a more generic club or com-pany name. As is often the case in the business of sport, Manchester
United have paved the way and have now dropped the FC from their
logo, leaving chocolates, beer and numerous other goods branded
simply as an ofﬁcial Manchester United product.
