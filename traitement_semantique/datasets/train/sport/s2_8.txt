REQUIREMENTS
The pitch must have a corner flag (a post with a flag at the top) at each of its four corners. Corner flags must be at least 1.5 m (5 ft) high and must 
not be pointed or dangerous.
Players must not move the corner flag to take a corner kick or throw-in.
There is a curved line (arc) drawn inside the pitch from the touchline to the goal line with a radius of 1 m (1 yd) from the corner flag. When a corner 
kick is taken, part of the ball must be on or overhanging this line, unless the ball is fully inside the line.
Sometimes, a small line can be marked outside the pitch 9.15 m (10 yds) along the touchlines and/or goal lines to help opponents stay at least 
9.15 m (10 yds) away at a corner kick.
At most levels, if there are no or not enough corner flags or if one breaks, the game should still be played.CORNER AREA & FLAGS
