REQUIREMENTS
Team officials, substitutes and substituted players are not allowed on the pitch without the referee’s permission. Each team usually has their own 
separate area, just outside the touchline.
At many levels of football, these areas are not marked – they are often called ‘benches’.
At higher levels of football, where these areas are marked out, they are called ‘technical areas’, and there are some specific requirements:
• the area must be at least 1 m (1 yd) from the touchline
• the area should not extend more than 1 m (1 yd) either side of the seating area
• competition rules will state how many people are allowed in the technical area (competition rules usually require them to be named on the 
team list)
• people in the technical area must behave responsibly. If they do not, they may be shown a red or yellow card
• only one person from each team is allowed to stand and coach at any one timeTECHNICAL AREA
