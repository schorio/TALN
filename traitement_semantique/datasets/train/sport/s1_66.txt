1.1.2. Circle ball
This game is suitable for children with lower limb impairment because it is played in a 
standing position.
Materials : - One or more balls, Whistle
How to play : - 
 Players stand in a circle, legs apart, outside of feet touching.
 Players try to score by rolling or throwing the ball across the circle and 
through the legs of another player.
 A point is scored if the ball goes through another player’s legs.
 Players use their hands to defend their ‘goal’ .
 A goal is disallowed if it is through the legs of a player next to the child throwing the ball.
Adaptations
 The more children who play the larger the circle becomes, so the slower and easier the game becomes.
 Use more than one ball to make the game faster and more difficult.
 Children who are more able are only allowed to use one hand to protect their ‘goal. ’
 You can blindfold some children to make it more difficult for them
 Wheelchair users can turn their chair ‘side on’ with the wheel facing into the circle representing their goal.
