that society is not based on equilibrium. It is argued that certain
sectors of society, especially in market economies, pursue their ownself-interests, yet project their vision in such a way that the majoritysupport them. Those studying conﬂict theory focus their research on
how powerful groups in society use sport to promote values and
aspirations that enable them to maintain their position of power andprivilege. It also illuminates how sport is a force of discontent andinequality in a society that perpetuates the uneven distribution ofpower and wealth. Areas that have been studied in the context ofconﬂict theory include the effects of commercialism in sport, thenegative impact of nationalism and militarism, the role of sport in
maintaining racial and gender imbalances, and the role that sport
plays in controlling society.

CONSUMPTION
In economic terms, consumption refers to the expenditure on goods
and services that are then used not stored. Hence both sports specta-tors (who pay to watch events) and sports participants (who purchaseequipment) are consumers in the sports market. In 1995 the sportssector was responsible for £10.4 billion of consumer spending (about2.3 per cent of total consumer expenditure). Most of this is spendingin the mass participation market, with 19 per cent going on sub-
scriptions and entry fees and a further 23 per cent being expended on
sports clothing and footwear. Another 28 per cent is spent ingambling activities associated with sport.
