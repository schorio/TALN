RESISTANCE THESIS
The resistance thesis has came to dominate the research agenda
within sports sociology in the period after the mid-1980s, and
replaced the reproduction thesis . Rather than arguing that sport
either mirrored or reproduced themes that were dominant within
society, the resistance thesis contended that sport was a site for min-
ority groups to challenge the social order. Research work has exam-
ined the use of sport by minority groups, such as those discriminatedagainst on the grounds of race, sex, disability or age. It has demon-strated that these groups use sport to resist the discrimination thatthey suffer within wider society, and that sport offers an opportunityto excel.

RESTRAINT OF TRADE
It is a fundamental principle of common law that individuals shouldbe allowed to pursue their trade or business without interference.Hence decisions made by governing bodies in sport which affect thelivelihood of players and the income of clubs can be challenged asbeing in restraint of trade. The leagues of many sports, for example,have instituted various restrictions on the labour market within theirsport. These have included the maximum wage in football until
1961, residential qualiﬁcations used in county cricket to restrict
player mobility until very recently, and salary caps currently oper-
ating in several British sports. T echnically, all these mechanisms are in
restraint of trade in that they raise impediments to the employment ofindividuals that could be against their wishes. The defence in law ishow reasonable is the restriction, something usually deﬁned in termsRESTRAINT OF TRADE
