DEFINITION
A player is penalised for offside if they are in an offside position at the moment the ball is played or touched (deliberately or accidentally) by a 
team-mate and then commits an offside offence.
OFFSIDE POSITION
A player is in an offside position when any part of their body* is:
• in the other team’s half (the halfway line does not count) and 
• closer to the opponents’ goal line than both:
 >the second-last opponent, including the goalkeeper and
 >the ball
*the hands and arms of all players (including the goalkeepers) are not included when judging an offside position.
The player’s position is judged at the moment the ball is played/touched by one of their team-mates.
NO OFFSIDE POSITION
A player is not in an offside position when they are:
• in their own half or on the halfway line
• behind or in line (level) with the second-last opponent (including the goalkeeper)
• behind or in line (level) with the ball
• in the opponents’ goal, as long as they are not committing an offside offence, e.g. interfering with the goalkeeper or a defender
When else is a player not offside?
Even if they are in an offside position, a player is not penalised for offside if they receive the ball:
• when the ball is deliberately played by an opponent, including the goalkeeper, unless it is a save, i.e. an attempt to stop the ball from going into 
or very close to the goal
• from an opponent’s deliberate handball
• directly from a:
 >throw-in
 >corner kick
 >goal kick
OFFSIDE OFFENCE
There are three different offside offences:
• interfering with play by playing or touching the ball (with any part of the body)
• interfering with an opponent by:
 >preventing them from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing their line of vision, especially the goalkeeper
 >challenging them for the ball
 >trying to play the ball when it is close and this affects an opponent
 >making an obvious action/movement that clearly affects an opponent’s ability to play the ball
• gaining an advantage by playing the ball or interfering with an opponent when the ball: OFFSIDE
