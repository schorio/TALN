from central government. Entry to such schools is open to all young
people between the ages of ﬁve and sixteen years, although in prac-tice this extends to students up to the age of eighteen years who wishto continue their education. State schools (ﬁrst known as Board
Schools until the 1902 Education Act when school boards were
abolished and control was transferred to county councils) were ﬁrstcreated as a result of the (Forster) Education Act of 1870.
Many other countries use the term ‘public school’ when referring
to state schools and this is sometimes a source of confusion when
referring to the UK, where ‘ public schools ’ are in fact independent
schools, funded by endowment and student fees. The term public
schools derives from the fact that some of the older foundations such
as Winchester and Eton were founded for poor scholars and in
theory they are open to any boy provided he wins a scholarship tocover the cost of fees.

STRATEGY FOR SPORT
Published in 2000, the Labour Government’s ‘Strategy for Sport’offered a major shake-up of school sport. It included the provision of300 multi-purpose sports and arts facilities for primary schools at acost of £150 million, National Lottery sports awards worth £50
million being earmarked for youth projects, further development ofclub/school links, and the employment of 600 sports coordinators todevelop competitive inter-school sport. The strengthening of the
links between schools, clubs and governing bodies was a central fea-
ture, though some critics feared that this would accentuate the moveaway from schools as being the traditional identiﬁer and developer ofyoung sporting talent. Other criticisms included the failure to insiston more than two hours a week being devoted to sport and physicalexercise in the National Curriculum and a reluctance to halt the
sales of school playing ﬁelds. In 2002 ‘Game Plan’, a report from thePrime Minister’s Strategy Unit, set out the necessary components for
a ‘strategy for delivering the Government’s sport and physical activity
objectives’ which included recommendations on developing theUnited Kingdom’s sport and physical activity culture; enhancing thenation’s international success; improving the approach to mega eventsand major sporting facilities; and improving the organizational struc-tures for delivering sport and physical activity.STRATEGY FOR SPORT
