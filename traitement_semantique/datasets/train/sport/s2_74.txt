DEFINITION
A yellow card is a card shown to someone when they are booked/cautioned. Yellow cards can be shown for offences by players, substitutes, 
substituted players, coaches and other team officials.
WHEN IT IS SHOWN
A person can be shown a yellow card from the time the referee goes onto the pitch to start the game until after the end of the game, including 
during half-time, the break before extra time, extra time, half-time of extra time and penalties.
If a player commits a yellow-card offence between the referee going onto the pitch for the pre-match inspection and the referee entering the pitch 
to start the game, no yellow card is shown. The incident is reported to the appropriate authorities after the game, but the player starts the game 
without a yellow card. This means that if they are shown a yellow card during the game, they are not sent off for two yellow cards in the same game.
In some competitions, a yellow card may result in the player being sent off for a short period of time and then returning to play (see: Sin bins 
(temporary dismissals)).
There are different reasons for the referee to show a yellow card, and many of them are officially categorised as ‘unsporting behaviour’.
The most common yellow-card offences are where a player, substitute or substituted player:
• commits a reckless challenge (foul)
• wastes time
• stops a promising attack by the other team, usually by committing a foul or handball (there is no card issued if a penalty kick is awarded for a 
foul that stops a promising attack and was an attempt to play the ball)
• denies the other team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick for a foul that was an attempt to play the ball
• argues with the referee or another match official (verbally or by gestures/actions)
• is not the minimum required distance at a free kick, corner kick, dropped ball or throw-in
• continuously fouls (no specific number of fouls have to be committed)
• simulates/dives to get a penalty/free kick or exaggerates to get another player a red or yellow card
• excessively celebrates a goal, e.g. takes their shirt off, jumps onto a fence, goes into the crowd, mocks opponents, wears a mask/covers their 
face with their shirt
Other reasons for a yellow card to be shown are if a player, substitute or substituted player:
• shows a lack of respect for the game or their opponents
• tries to score a goal with their hand/arm (even if unsuccessful)
• enters, re-enters or leaves the pitch without the referee’s permission
• changes places with the goalkeeper during play or without the referee’s permission
• makes illegal marks on the pitch
• plays the ball after being given permission by the referee to leave the pitch
• uses a trick to get round the backpass Law
• verbally distracts an opponent
A yellow card is shown to a team official who:
• continuously leaves their bench/technical area
• delays the restart of play by their team
• enters the other team’s technical area (without any major confrontation)
• argues with the referee or other match official (without leaving the technical area)
• continuously signals for a red or yellow card to be shown to someoneYELLOW CARDS
