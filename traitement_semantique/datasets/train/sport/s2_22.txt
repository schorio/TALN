REQUIREMENTS
Depending on the level of the game, the referee may be helped by other people known as match officials. They are usually neutral and qualified 
officials, or, at the lower levels of the game, people prepared to help, e.g. each team might provide someone to be an assistant referee.
The other officials help the referee, but, according to the Laws, the referee is the only person who can make a decision.
ASSISTANT REFEREES
There are usually two assistant referees, who are on the touchline on diagonally opposite sides of the pitch. They move up and down the defending 
team’s half of the touchline and keep in line with the second-last defender (including the goalkeeper).
The most important role of the assistant referees is to help the referee with:
• goal kicks, corner kicks and throw-ins (including by signalling that the ball went out of play)
• offsides
Neutral and qualified assistant referees may also help the referee with fouls and handball offences, especially if the referee cannot see an incident 
clearly.
Assistant referees may also help the referee in other areas, including:
• checking the pitch, goals and other equipment before the game
• when a substitution is being made
• keeping a record of goals, red and yellow cards, substitutions, etc.
• timekeeping
• monitoring the behaviour of the coaches, substitutes, substituted players and other team officials (if close to the benches/technical areas)
There are standard signals used by assistant referees:OTHER MATCH (REFEREE) OFFICIALS
