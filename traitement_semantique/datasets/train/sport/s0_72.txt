and ruled from England, or should they retreat to indigenous sport-
ing forms? This is at the heart of the postcolonial dilemma. Mostnations that have been through the process of decolonisation havecontinued to play imperial sports, have prospered at them, and taken
great delight at beating the ‘mother’ country. Such victories were
seen as the triumph of postcolonial nations. However, other nationsthat have been through the process of decolonisation, such as theRepublic of Ireland, chose to leave the Commonwealth, and thus theCommonwealth Games , and have also continued to champion
indigenous sports such as hurling and Gaelic football. In recent dec-ades there is a growing feeling that some decolonised nations, espe-cially those in the West Indies, have been subject to the forces of
cultural imperialism , and have steadily turned their backs on
imperial sports in favour of baseball and basketball.

sport. The demand for sport is a composite one, involving the demand
for free time, the demand for equipment and clothing, the demandfor travel and the demand for facilities. Additionally the demand for sport
can relate to both spectating and participation, though these generally
are in distinct markets.
