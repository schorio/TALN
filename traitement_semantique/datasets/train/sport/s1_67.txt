1.1.3. Cross-fire 
A similar game to dodgeball, but a little slower! Because players walk rather than run, 
it’s suitable for children with mobility impairments, and can also be used as a warm-down activity.
Materials 
 Marker saucers
 A large number of balls, preferably soft balls such as foam or beach balls
 Whistle
How to play
 Divide the players into two teams. Players from one team line up in two rows 
opposite a partner and roll a ball back and forth to each other.
 Meanwhile players from the other team, one by one, try to walk along the channel between the pairs without being hit by a ball.
 The moving player cannot step/jump over the balls but can pause to let them pass by.
 Balls must be rolled along the floor – no bouncing. 
 A player who successfully reaches the end of the channel scores a point.
 When all players from one team have tried to walk through the channel, the two teams swap over.
 After every one has played, add up the points scored – the team with highest total wins!
Adaptations 
To make the game easier or more difficult for children, change the rules, eg. some 
children are allowed to run or to step/jump over the balls, or some children are allowed to throw or kick the balls instead of rolling them.
