FOULS  
a foul and technical offence occur at the same time (e.g. foul and offside)?
The foul is punished (more serious offence).
a stopping-a-promising-attack (SPA) foul is also a reckless foul?
A yellow card is shown to the player for being reckless, which is more serious than the tactical nature of SPA.
a foul is committed, but the fouled team can continue with the ball?
The referee can allow play to continue (see: Advantage).
