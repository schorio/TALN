Physical anthropologists are interested in understanding biological
variation and attempts to interpret meaningfully the wide range of
variability characteristics of humans. In physical education and sportthis concern is manifested in studies of human growth and develop-
ment in relation to physical activity, and increasingly in studies of
how our environment impacts our biology. Thus the effects ofmodern technologies such as the motor car, the computer and otherlabour-saving devices, have had an impact on the levels of physicalactivity of the populace in general, but certainly on the activity pat-terns of children (and thus on their growth and development) inparticular. It is in this area that scholars such as Malina have madesigniﬁcant contributions to our understanding of the signiﬁcance of
physical activity to normal growth and development, and the impact
that both excessive and minimal amounts of appropriate physicalactivity can have on the human organism, its structure and function.

ARBITRATION
The idea of avoiding legal process and expense by turning to arbi-
tration for the resolution of disputes has been slow to emerge in
sport, though the International Olympic Committee has established aCouncil of Arbitration for Sport based in Lausanne, Switzerland andSydney, Australia. In the UK the Central Council for PhysicalRecreation is considering the introduction of a similar body forBritish sport.

ARCHIVES
Alongside the preservation of sporting venues and memorabilia inpersonal and public collections, one of the most important ways of
understanding the sporting past is through archives. Without archival
material, it is difﬁcult for researchers wishing to understand sport in ahistorical context to conduct their work. As the awareness of theARBITRATION
