placed as shown in the diagram:
The child begins at the starting marker. 
She runs to any ball and kicks it through 
the goal. The child is only allowed to kick the ball once. The player then runs and kicks another ball through the goal. When the player kicks the last ball, the clock is stopped.
Scoring - the total time (in seconds) 
elapsed from when the player starts to 
when she kicks the last ball is recorded and converted into points using a chart (eg. the same as the one above, or adapted from this). A bonus of five points is added for each ball kicked successfully through the goal. Five points are deducted if the child uses her hands.
