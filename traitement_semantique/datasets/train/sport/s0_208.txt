ROTATION
Rotation or angular motion takes place when a body moves along a
circular path about some line in space so that all parts of the body
travel through the same angle, in the same direction, in the same
time. An example would be a gymnast performing a giant swing on ahorizontal bar where the centre of the bar forms the axis aroundwhich the body moves in a circular path.

RULES
Sport is a rule-governed practice: constitutive rules, both prescriptiveand proscriptive, deﬁne required equipment and facilities as well assetting the formal rules of play; auxiliary rules specify and control
eligibility both to the sport but more particularly to the event; and
regulatory rules such as dress codes place restraints on behaviourindependent of the sport itself. Initially, rules tended to be restricted
geographically, relating to a game or sport played in a particular
locality, but over time the desire for regional, national and interna-tional competition led to a codiﬁcation of rules so that the sport wasplayed everywhere under the same regulations. Rule formulation isa dynamic process and over time rule changes have been inﬂuencedby gambling, fair play ideology, economic pressures and legalintervention.

SAFETY
With participation in sport and physical activity, and particularly in
contact sports such as rugby and boxing, comes an increased risk ofaccident and injury. Accordingly, those involved in sports medicine
have directed much time and attention to increasing efforts to pro-mote safety in sport, not only in regard to appropriate methods oftraining, but also in the use of equipment, and facilities to betterprepare athletes for competition. Athletes who are physically ﬁt andwell prepared are less at risk of injury and less likely to incur dis-ability. The safety of spectators has become of major importance inROTATION
