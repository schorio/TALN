DEFINITION
The team that scores more goals than the other team is the winner of the game.
When no goals are scored or both teams score the same number of goals, it is a draw.
Competition rules will determine how many points are awarded for a win or a draw.
If a game (or two-legged cup tie) is drawn and a winner is needed, the competition rules will state that the winning team is decided by using one 
or a combination of:
• extra time
• penalties
• the away goals rule (goals scored away from home count ‘double’)
