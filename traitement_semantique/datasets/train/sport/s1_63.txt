Good attitude  of the play leader
As discussed earlier, the attitude of the play leader sets the tone for the whole session. 
The play leader is like a mirror – if she is enthusiastic and full of energy, the children will follow suit – they will be happier and get much more enjoyment from the session.
Good participation  of all
Make sure that all the children are actively participating according to their ability. This participation should come about through your encouragement, not coercion. Be observant to see which children appear to be excluded. If a child appears to be excluded, find out the reasons why and try to address them. Accept also that a child 
with physical impairment may need more rest than other children. Use the appropriate 
adaptations (STEP) to make sure that the child is given every opportunity to participate.
Good safety
Inclusive play is safe play! Chapter 6 discusses health and safety issues in more detail.
Good ending
End your session with a cool-down activity or game, and perhaps a closing ceremony (a song, lowering of the flag, etc), to build solidarity and friendships between the children and to encourage them to come again. The end of the session is a good time to ask the children for their feedback about the session so that you can make improvements for 
next time.
Good fun!
The most important is that the play/coaching session must be fun and rewarding for the 
child. A child will only get the benefits (health, social, psychological) from participation in sport and play if she associates the experience with enjoyment and fun. 
Don’t be afraid to have 
some silly ideas when 
closing a play session!
