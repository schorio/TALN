The whistle is used to stop the game, usually for a foul, handball, offside, injury or to signal that the ball has gone out of play when it is not clear. 
It is usually only used to restart the game for important situations, e.g. after a goal, red or yellow card, injury or substitution, or for an attacking 
free kick or penalty kick.
If the referee becomes ill or injured and cannot continue, the game is abandoned unless the competition rules allow one of the other match officials 
(assistant referees or fourth official) to take over.

REQUIREMENTS
Every game must have a referee who controls the game, players and team officials by applying the Laws. The referee’s decision is final and must 
always be respected.
The referee has the authority to award free kicks and penalty kicks and to decide which team gets a throw-in, goal kick, corner kick or dropped ball.
The referee’s main responsibility is to use the Laws to make sure the game is played fairly and safely.
When applying the Laws, the referee must consider the ‘spirit’ of the Law i.e. what is the main purpose of the Law and what is the fairest outcome, 
especially where something happens that is not directly covered by the Laws?
The referee controls the game and may show a red or yellow card for some offences (see: Red cards and Yellow cards).
In some lower-level competitions, a yellow card results in a temporary dismissal with the player spending some time off the pitch (in the sin bin) 
before returning to the game.
The referee must keep a record of the main events in the game, particularly the goals, substitutions and red and yellow cards.
There are standard signals used by referees.
