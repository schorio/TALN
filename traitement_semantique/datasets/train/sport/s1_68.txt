1.1.4. Time-out!  
A game that can be played seated or standing, so is suitable for children with limited 
mobility.
Materials 
 Basketballs or other large, soft balls
 Whistle 
How to play
 Players gather in a circle (seated or standing).
 Players pass the ball to each other across and around the circle. The ball can be 
passed in any way; for example, chest, bounce or high pass.
 The time-keeper (eg. the play leader) blows a whistle or calls ‘Stop’ after every 20 
seconds; the person with the ball when the whistle goes drops out of the game.
 The leader blows the whistle or calls ‘Time’ to end the game after 2 minutes.
 The players remaining in the game score 1 point.
 The clock is re-set and the next round starts. Agree a number of rounds before 
counting up individual scores.

1.1.5. Pick up fruits
Materials 
 Small soft balls (about 6)
 Marker saucers
 Whistle 
How to play
 Arrange a playing area in the shape of a square, each side being about 5 metres 
long (depending on the age and size of the children). Place a marker saucer on each corner of the square. Place the small soft balls (the ‘fruit’) in the middle of the square.
 Arrange the children into four teams of equal abilities, eg. 5 or 6 children per team. The game is played in several rounds. In each round, one child from each team stands at a different corner of the square, by a marker saucer. On the whistle, all the children run to the centre of the square, grab a ball, and run back to their 
corner and deposit it there. Each child can then run back to the centre to pick 
another ‘fruit’ , or can ‘steal’ a fruit from one of the other corners of the square. But each child is only allowed to pick up one fruit at a time.
 After an allotted amount of time the play leader blows the whistle again and the team with the most ‘fruits’ scores one point.
