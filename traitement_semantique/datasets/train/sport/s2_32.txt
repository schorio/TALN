DEFINITION
If the referee stops the game and no foul or other offence has occurred, the game restarts with a dropped ball.
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN?
The referee restarts play with a dropped ball when:
• play stops because of an injury or something serious (bad weather, spectators on the pitch, a spectator blows a whistle that interferes with the 
game, floodlights go out, etc.)
• play is stopped because of interference by an outside agent
• the ball touches the referee (or another match official), stays on the pitch and:
 >goes into the goal
 >the team in possession of the ball changes
 >a promising attack starts
• the referee blows the whistle by mistake and stops the game
When there is a dropped ball:
• the referee drops the ball
• players from both teams must be at least 4 m (4.5 yds) from the ball, apart from the player receiving the dropped ball
• the ball is in play when it touches the ground – it must not be touched before that
• the player receiving the dropped ball can continue playing with it but cannot score unless it touches at least one other player (from either team)
The ball is dropped for a player of the team that last touched the ball at the place where it last touched a player, match official or outside agent. 
However, the ball is dropped for the goalkeeper (regardless of which team last touched the ball) if, when the referee stopped play:
• the last touch was in the penalty area or
• the ball was in the penalty area (whether on the ground or in the air)
WHAT HAPPENS IF...DROPPED BALL / BOUNCED BALL
a player touches the ball before it touches the ground?
The dropped ball is retaken.
a player is less than 4 m (4.5 yds) away?
The dropped ball is retaken and the offending player may be shown a yellow card.
the ball goes out over the goal line or touchline without touching any player?
The dropped ball is retaken.
