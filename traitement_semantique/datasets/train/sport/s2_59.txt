DEFINITION
Feinting is when a player tries to trick an opponent by pretending (dummying) to kick the ball, but then delays the kick or does not kick the ball.
Feinting is allowed for free kicks, goal kicks and corner kicks. It is also permitted in the run-up to a penalty kick, but not once the kicker has 
completed the run-up (including during penalties).
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN?
If, when taking a free kick, goal kick or corner kick, the kicker feints to take the kick, the opponents must remain at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the 
ball until the kick is taken.
When a penalty is being taken, the kicker: 
• can stop and start during the run-up
• must kick the ball immediately at the end of their run-up, i.e. they cannot feint (pretend) to kick the ball
WHAT HAPPENS IF...FEINTING / DUMMYING
(Free kicks, goal kicks, corner kicks) 
the kicker feints to kick the ball, and an opponent moves closer than 9.15 m (10 yds) to the ball and interferes with the kick?
The opponent is shown a yellow card and the kick is retaken.
(Penalty kick and during penalties) 
the kicker feints at the end of the run-up but does not kick the ball?
The kicker is shown a yellow card and the kick is then taken correctly.
(Penalty kick and during penalties) 
the kicker feints at the end of the run-up and then kicks the ball?
Penalty kick: the kicker is shown a yellow card and an indirect free kick is awarded to the other team.
During penalties: the kicker is shown a yellow card and the kick is recorded as missed.
