1.4.2. Beanbag target game
Bean bags (see section 1.6.1 in this chapter) can be used in 
various ways including in target games.
Materials
 Beanbags (or small balls), Marker saucers, Target (eg. floor 
target, buckets, skittles, etc)
How to play
Playing this game depends on what target you are using. For example you can use:
 a ready-made target with scores marked on it
 a basket, or series of baskets
 skittles, which can be bought or can be made, eg. out of empty drinks bottles. 
Normally the game is played with ten skittles.
Players take it in turn to throw beanbags towards the target and get scores accordingly. 
For the ready-made target, the scores are indicated on the target itself. For baskets, you 
can give different scores according to the size of the basket or the distance from the player. For skittles, the score is the number of skittles knocked down with one throw.
Adaptations
Vary the distance of the player from the target, according to her ability.
Change the rules, eg. give the player more chances to throw, or a less able throwerâ€™s 
scores are doubled, etc.

A very popular game with children, which can get quite fast and physical. So children with disabilities may need extra support or adaptations!

How to play
 Divide the group into two teams. One team forms a circle which is marked

examples of 
targets are
