INSTITUTIONALISATION
Sport is an institutionalised activity. This is a sociological term which
relates to the processes through which conduct and organisation arestandardised over time. As sport is an activity that is governed by rulesand regulations, relating, for example, to the number of players onthe ﬁeld, the size of the pitch or the weight of the ball, it is thereforesubject to institutionalisation. Coakley (1998) has argued that the
process of institutionalisation, in the context of sport, results in the
following: the rules of the activity become standardised; ofﬁcial reg-ulatory agencies take over rule enforcement; the organisational andtechnical aspects of the activity become important; and the learningof games skills becomes formalised.
As international organisations such as the IOC and FIFA become
more powerful and globalised, so the force of institutionalisationbecomes stronger, and sporting activity is ever more controlled.

INSTRUMENTALITY
In studying aggression andviolence , researchers have attempted to
clarify an important distinction between acts of aggression and violencethat are means to an end (instrumental aggression) and acts that areends in themselves (hostile aggression). The concept of instrumentalityrefers to those acts that are means (or instruments) to an end. So while
in cases of both instrumental and hostile aggression, the intent is to
inﬂict physical and/or psychological harm to another person or per-sons, acts of instrumental aggression are performed in order to elicitexternal positive reinforcement from coaches, fans and/or team-mates. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that we witness such behaviourwhen we hear coaches imploring players to ‘be more aggressive’.
