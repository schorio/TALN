sport and play – making it inclusive
T he previous chapter explained the concepts of inclusive sport, adapted 
sport and disability sport, and gave various ways in which children with 
and without disabilities can play together through presenting two conceptual 
models. This chapter will give more concrete, practical ways how this can be done. This includes some general principles of working with children with disabilities in sport and physical activity, some specific tips related to certain impairments, and general ideas about games and sports which lend themselves more easily to inclusion (and also some activities which should be avoided).
Do you remember STEP? This was briefly introduced in the last chapter. STEP 
(space, task, equipment and people) comes from the Inclusion Spectrum model of inclusive sport, and gives us a framework for recognising what we can adapt to bring about effective inclusion. This chapter will go into much more detail about how STEP can be put into practice.Key Learning
