FORCE
Possessing both magnitude and direction, force is a vector quantity,
and is ‘the effect that one body has on another’. (Wells and Luttgens1976: 291) All motion is derived from the application of force, be itforce from muscular contractions, force from gravity or force from
friction. The major concern for those involved in sport and physicalactivity is in changing the state of motion of athletes and theirimplements, be they javelins, tennis rackets, soccer balls, etc. In
addition to direction and magnitude, critical to any analysis of force is
its point of application. The effect of force varies with its point ofapplication, as we see when we hit a tennis ball closer to the top orbottom, thereby providing topspin or backspin with resultant changesin trajectory and ﬂight. We measure force as the product of mass andacceleration, using the unit weight as the measure of magnitude. Thedirection of force is along its action line. Gravity exerts a downwardvertical force, while muscular force is represented by the direction of
a muscle’s line of pull.

FRANCHISES
Most common in American sport, franchises are the granting of the
right to play in a particular tournament to the owners of a team.
These owners can, and do, take the franchise with them to anothercity or sell to another aspiring owner elsewhere. In Britain suchtransferable private ownership of sports teams is rare, though it occursin ice-hockey and speedway. In rugby league the right to competehas been withdrawn from several teams in an effort by the leagueorganisers to assure quality control.
FREE AGENTS
When professional sportspeople complete their contract with a clubthey are regarded as free agents and are legally entitled to negotiateanother contract with any potential employer without any transfer feeFORCE
