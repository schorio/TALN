questions of ethics. Thus questions about how we ought to treat one

debates in sport philosophy. Debates and discussion over such issues as
sportsmanship, fair play , cheating and winning, and issues concern-
ing performance-enhancing drugs anddrug testing , have been
particularly important in demonstrating the practical importance ofphilosophical inquiry in sport and physical activity. And whereasissues of value relating to the aesthetic aspects of sport and physicalactivity have been raised by philosophers such as Best, who are inter-ested in qualitative aspects of sport performance such as grace and
style, and whether forms of sport qualify as works of art, it has been
the ethical issues that have dominated axiological analysis of sport andphysical education.
The development of the ﬁeld of sport philosophy, and the corpus
of work that has been produced in the past thirty years, mirrors theincreasing interest in and concern about sport and physical activity assigniﬁcant and meaningful human activities, worthy of philosophicanalysis.
