2. The Inclusion Spectrum
A more recent model of inclusion put forward 
by Stevenson and Black (2011) is similar to that of Winnick but is based more on school and community-level PE and physical activity rather 
than formalised sport. Another difference is that 
rather than seeing inclusion as being hierarchical (ranging from ‘more inclusive’ to ‘less inclusive’), the Inclusion Spectrum depicts the different types of inclusion as being of equal importance and therefore circular.There are six types of inclusive sport/play in the Inclusion Spectrum. The first one is ‘Everyone Can Play’ , in which children with disability participate in naturally inclusive activities based on what 
each child can do, with little or no modifications 
or adaptations. For example:
	warm-up and cool-down activities, where 
children can find the level of participation 
that they can manage
	free dance activities, where each child can express himself in the way he can
	collecting or gathering games, eg. gathering up objects scattered around the playing area 
and arranging them by colour (‘cups and 
saucers’ is one such game, see chapter 5).
