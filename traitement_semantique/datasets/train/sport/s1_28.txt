Chapter  III
inclusive sport and play – the basics
T he fact that you’re reading this manual suggests that you’re probably 
involved in sport, either as a play leader, PE teacher or sports officer/coach. 
So you’re probably already well aware of the many benefits of sport and play for 
children. However you may not be aware of the particular benefits that sport and play can have for children with disabilities. This chapter will remind you of 
the benefits of sport and play for all  children, while highlighting the particular 
benefits for those with a disability.
While sport brings many benefits to children we should be realistic and be aware 
that it can also have negative impacts. These need to be recognised so that we 
can prevent them.
The degree and type of inclusion which is possible in sport depends on factors 
such as the type and severity of impairment, and the type of sport/physical 
activity. This chapter will explore this in more detail, presenting two models which illustrate the types and degrees of inclusion which are possible in sport. 
These models will introduce the concepts of adapted sport, disability sport and 
adapted physical activity (APA) – how sport and games can be modified to make them accessible for children with disabilities.Key Learning
