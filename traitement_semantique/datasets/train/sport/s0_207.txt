agement to sport involves attempts to identify, evaluate and control
the risks involved in sports participation as a means to the promotionof health and safety, by the provision of information and advice toensure that the potential dangers are avoided, or at least arise less
frequently, and are of a less serious nature. Those charged with risk
management are required to understand the potential dangers of, andlegal liability associated with, the use of sporting equipment andfacilities, just as they need to understand the law as it relates to par-ticipation in sport and physical activity, and as it relates to issues ofsafety and health.

RITUAL
Many sport psychologists consider ritual to be a form of interventiontechnique used by athletes as a means of enhancing exercise and sportperformance. One important goal of intervention strategies is to
maximise the chances of achieving an ideal performance state or peak
performance. Ritual is often seen as a means of focusing attention.And because the rituals that athletes select are those that are con-nected in their minds with past successes, ritual, like self-talk, isengaged in as a means of intentionally thinking about positive pastsuccesses. As such, athletes who employ pre-match rituals are inten-tionally providing themselves with behaviours that are used to con-vince them that they are conﬁdent, motivated and ready to perform.
Ritual becomes a means of both mental preparation and constructive
intervention, signifying the beginning of the athletic contest and thusthe need to focus on the contest if success is to be achieved. Ritualscan range from team activities such as pre-match pep talks, prayers orwarm-ups, to individual activities involving the ritual laying out ofone’s equipment, cleaning of equipment, or listening to speciﬁcpieces of music on a personal CD or cassette player.
