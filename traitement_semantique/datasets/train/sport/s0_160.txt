on outcome goals, and attribute successes to luck or ease of the task;
they attribute failure to low ability.
Finally, much of the research on motivation in sport and physical
activity has been biased towards the younger end of the age scale. We
now need to know more about motivation of older adults and the
changes in motivation that occur across the life-span if we are tofoster continued physical activity for people of all ages. Furtherresearch on interventions to promote physical activity and lifestylechange is also necessary if we are to understand how best to helppeople make physical activity part of their daily lives.

MOTOR SKILL
The acquisition of perceptual-motor skills is fundamental to human
existence. At each stage within the cycle of life, humans continuouslystrive to acquire new skills or to reﬁne existing ones in the hope thatproductivity and quality of life is enhanced. This is particularly thecase within the domain of sport where individuals are judged almost
exclusively by their ability to reproduce such skills, often in a diverse
range of performance settings.

MOTOR UNITS
A single motor nerve cell in the spinal cord, together with its nerve
ﬁbre and the muscle ﬁbres emanating from its branches, make up asingle motor unit. Motor units abide by the ‘all-or-nothing’ law so
that when nervous stimulation received by the motor unit is of suf-
ﬁcient intensity and duration, the muscle ﬁbres of that motor unit allcontract. This all-or-nothing response does not apply to an entiremuscle, however. Only the number of muscle ﬁbres required to pickup a book or close a door are activated, and thus only a speciﬁcnumber of motor units are active. During prolonged activity, motorMOTOR SKILL
