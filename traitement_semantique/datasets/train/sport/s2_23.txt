FOURTH OFFICIAL 
The fourth official stands in between the two benches/technical areas and helps the referee in various ways, including by:
• checking the pitch, goals and other equipment before the game
• giving advice about fouls, handball offences or other incidents that the referee cannot see clearly
• checking a substitute’s kit and making sure they enter the pitch at the halfway line, but only after the player being substituted has left the pitch 
and the referee has signalled for them to do so
• controlling the coaches, substitutes, substituted players and other team officials
• keeping a record of goals, red and yellow cards, substitutions, etc.
• indicating the minimum amount of additional time to be played at the end of each half
VIDEO ASSISTANT REFEREES (VARS) 
Some top-level competitions use the VAR system. This involves a qualified video assistant referee (VAR) helped by one or more qualified assistant 
VARs (AVARs) watching replays of major incidents to check if anything serious has been missed or the referee has made a ‘clear and obvious error’
