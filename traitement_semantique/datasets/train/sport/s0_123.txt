Hooliganism was rife in British football during the 1970s and
1980s. Many explanations for its rise focused on the economicrecessions of the period that affected heavy industry, a dominant andviolent masculine culture, the impact of racism and far-right politics,and the terrace culture of stadia. Better policing methods and greaterintelligence had an impact on the levels of hooligan behaviour, butthe greatest shift in attitudes was as a result of the Taylor Report. All-seater stadia have dramatically reduced levels of hooliganism,although the experiences of the World Cup ﬁnal in 1998 and the
European Championships in 2000 demonstrate that hooligan ele-
ments now attach themselves to the English national football team.

HORMONES
Regulation of the body to achieve homeostasis is accomplished lar-gely by two systems: the nervous system and the endocrine system.The endocrine system exerts its control through the release and useof hormones into the blood to circulate to tissues. Hormones arechemical messengers which bind to a speciﬁc protein acting in alock-and-key manner and are divided into two basic types: steroid
and non-steroid hormones, with chemical structure and solubility
level being the distinguishing features of the two types. The effectthat a hormone exerts is directly related to its concentration in theblood and the number of active receptors to which it can bind.
