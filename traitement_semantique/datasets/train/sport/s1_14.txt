Chapter  II
disability and inclusion
W hat is disability? This chapter will answer this basic question. While 
disability is often viewed in terms of a person’s physical or medical 
deficiencies, this chapter will challenge this view. A person’s functional abilities 
(eg. moving, seeing and hearing) are important to consider and to address, but this is only part of the ‘creation of disability’. This chapter will start by presenting a medical classification of disability (including the main causes of disability), and then explain the ‘social model’ of disability, which highlights other factors which contribute to the disabling process. This leads on to the concept of inclusion, and in particular what inclusion means for participation in sport. The barriers to participation in sport will be explained – physical, social, economic and legal barriers. Key Learning
