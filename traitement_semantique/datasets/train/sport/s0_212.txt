world of sport.
SHAMATEURISM
This term was devised in the late nineteenth century to describethose sportsmen who wished to be paid for their efforts withoutundergoing the stigma of being labelled as a professional . Histori-
cally, the home of shamateurism was English county cricket, whereliberal ‘expenses’ and jobs as assistant secretary enabled many ama-teurs to take home more money than most professional players. Dr
W . G. Grace, the famous cricket all-rounder who regularly captained
the amateur Gentlemen against the professional Players, was anamateur but obtained £1,500 to tour Australia as captain of the
English team in 1873/1874 and £3,000 plus expenses eighteen yearslater, an amount almost equal to that received by the professionalmembers of the touring party in aggregate. Perhaps this money couldbe considered as reasonable compensation for the employment of alocum and loss of earnings while overseas, but the ethics of an ama-
teur pocketing nearly £1,500 from a testimonial in 1879 and over
£9,000 from another in 1895 are questionable. Shamateurism con-tinued well into the twentieth century, but then declined as the needfor subterfuge was no longer necessary after a general relaxation ofamateur regulations that allowed trust funds to be established forovert earnings from participation and endorsements, from whichathletes could draw to meet their expenses and receive the residual onretirement from sport. Moreover as many sports became open and
welcomed professionalism, the social stigma attached to being paid to
play lessened almost to vanishing point.
