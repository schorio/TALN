Likewise, since the pull of gravity inﬂuences the stability of the
body during the performance of physical activity, the balance or
appropriate distribution of those gravitational forces upon the body isessential to promoting stability or ‘balance’. The location of the
centre of gravity, or the point around which the mass or sum of
gravitational forces is equally distributed or ‘balanced’, is thus of vitalimport in the performance of physical skills. We know that the lowerthe centre of gravity and the closer it is to the base of support, themore stable an object. Thus when rugby players scrummage theyattempt to get their body weight as low as possible to avoid beingpushed backwards. Likewise, when those involved in a tug-of-war pullon the rope they try to lower their centre of gravity by leaning back-
wards and planting their feet well in front of them to increase stability
and decrease their chances of being pulled forward by their opponents.

GYMNASTICS
The term gymnastics is often applied to the use of movement tosustain, develop and exercise control of the body in an athletic oraesthetic context. Historically the term has frequently been linkedwith others such as ‘gymnastic training’ or ‘gymnastic exercise’,which could be militaristic or therapeutic in motivation. T wo major
European schools of thought have inﬂuenced British gymnastics. Incompetitive gymnastics the German system became dominant, with
its rings, high bar, horse and parallel bars, but in the educational
sphere the Swedish system became the most inﬂuential, partly
because its beams, ropes and vaulting box were more easily ﬁnancedthan the swings, slides, pulley systems, ropes and rigging, climbingframes and vaulting pits of the German variety.
