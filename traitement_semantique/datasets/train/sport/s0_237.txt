TEACHING STYLES
T eaching styles vary from those that are totally teacher-directed,
through those that encourage cooperation between teachers and stu-
dents, to those that allow almost complete student autonomy. This
continuum is probably best exempliﬁed by the ‘Spectrum of teachingstyles’ developed by Muska Mosston and Sara Ashworth, whichillustrates the shift from absolute control by the teacher (commandstyle) to a situation where students work independently of the teacher(self-teaching style). The ‘Spectrum’ embraces eleven styles as below:
/C15command style
/C15practice style
/C15reciprocal style
/C15self-check style
/C15inclusion style
/C15guided discovery style
/C15convergent discovery style
/C15divergent production style
/C15learner-designed individual programme style
/C15learner-initiated style
/C15self-teaching style.
Some of the above styles apply particularly to physical education
scenarios. A teacher may employ the ‘command style’ with very largegroups or beginners, even though this may be dispensed with after aninitial period. ‘Practice’ and ‘guided discovery’ styles are oftenappropriate in the teaching of gymnastic- or games skills, and ‘self-
check’ learner-focused styles may be utilised in today’s national cur-
riculum, where self-assessment and problem-solving can enhance thestudents’ perception of their own involvement in the physical edu-cation process.
