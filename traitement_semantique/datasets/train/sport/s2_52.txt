• obstructing/impeding an opponent’s progress** (with contact)
• biting or spitting at anyone on the team lists or a match official
• throwing something at the ball, an opponent or a match official, or using/holding something to make contact with the ball.
What fouls are punished with an indirect free kick?
The following fouls are punished with an indirect free kick as long as there is no contact (contact fouls require a direct free kick):
• playing dangerously* e.g. high foot (no contact)
• obstructing/impeding an opponent’s progress** (no contact)
• preventing/blocking a goalkeeper from releasing the ball from their hands
• trying to kick/play the ball when the goalkeeper is holding it
• committing any other offence not mentioned in the Laws, for which play is stopped to show a player a red or yellow card
*Playing dangerously is when a player attempts to play the ball and could injure someone (including the player themself) and/or prevents a nearby 
opponent from trying to play the ball for the fear of getting injured. An overhead, bicycle or scissors kick is allowed if there is no danger to a player 
from the other team.
**Obstruction is when a player moves into an opponent’s path to block, slow down or force a change of direction when neither player can play the 
ball. It is not a foul if players are already in each other’s space and an accidental collision or contact results.
