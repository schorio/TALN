Summary of the two models of inclusion in sport
What these two models tell us is that there is no single answer to the question ‘what is inclusive sport?’ 
How children with disabilities can be included in sport depends on the type and degree of disability, and the nature of the sport or physical activity. Possible forms of inclusion in sport are:
	children with and without disabilities playing together, with no additional support and with no adaptations needed to the sport
	children with disabilities playing a non-adapted sport with children without disabilities, thanks to additional support such as rehabilitation equipment 
	children with disabilities playing adapted versions of sports with children without disabilities. These include adaptation to the playing space, the task, the equipment and people (STEP).
	children (with and without disabilities) divided into ability groups so that they can participate on differentiated tasks within the same group
	reverse inclusion, where children without disabilities play an adapted or disability sport with children with disabilities, eg. a wheelchair race.
	parallel inclusion, where children with disabilities play adapted/disability sport and children without disabilities play mainstream sport, separately but alongside each other, eg. a joint volleyball/sitting volleyball tournament.
The next chapter of the manual will explore these options and possibilities in more depth.
