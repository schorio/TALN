aesthetically pleasing body that demonstrates physical prowess. Mess-
ner (1992) and Connell (1990) have both demonstrated how notionsof masculinity are linked with the creation of a ‘strong’ body. Men inteam sports have always been seen as creating and sustaining hege-
monic ideas of masculinity, especially through the ‘locker-room’
culture. Curry (1991) has shown how the ‘locker-room’ aids not onlya culture of masculinity, but also one that is hostile to positive orempowering images of women.
Although studies of masculinity are often concerned with domi-
nant ideologies of power, the concept has been problematised in thecontext of non-white and non-heterosexual males. Ideas of masculi-nity have had to be reappraised in light of images of strong black
men, such as Michael Jordan, and elite gay sportsmen such as Justin
Fashanu.
