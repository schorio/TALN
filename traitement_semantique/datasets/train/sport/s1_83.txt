1.5.10. Scavenger hunt
This game can be used as an ice-breaker and a team-building exercise, helping the 
children to get to know each other.
Materials 
 None
How to play 
 The play leader forms the children into small groups, eg. of five.
 The play leader requests the groups to go and fetch some items. The first team 
to bring back each item scores a point. The play leader should make sure that 
the items can be easily (and safely!) found by the children quite quickly, in the 
immediate locality, eg. a leaf from the aalamaram tree, a jasmine flower, a pencil, a plastic bag, etc.
Adaptation
To make sure that the child with disability is central to the game, the play leader could 
cleverly call out something that she knows the child has, eg. if she notices the child is wearing red flip-flops, calling out ‘a red flipflop. ’

1.6. Equipment-specific games and activities
Here are some game activities using specific pieces of play equipment which you may not familiar with.
1.6.1 Beanbags
Beanbags are a very useful piece of sport/play equipment; they are easier to catch than balls because they don’t bounce or roll. Plus as well as being used in throwing and catching activities they can also be used in balancing activities. Unfortunately beanbags are not commercially available in Sri 
Lanka although they can easily be made locally using cloth and beans or 
seeds (although care must be taken to keep them dry).
Here are some activities you can do with beanbags:
Balance beanbag
 Balance the beanbag on as many different parts of the body as 
possible; for example, on an out-stretched arm or leg, back, head or 
elbow;
 Balance it on their head while seated on the floor, then try to 
stand up without it falling off - no hands allowed!
 Move while balancing the bag on part of their body.   Beanbag balancing and
