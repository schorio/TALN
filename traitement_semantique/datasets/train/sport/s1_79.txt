1.5.3. Dragon’s tail 
Materials
	 None
How to play
	 All children except one stand in a single 
file line facing one direction with their hands 
on the waist of the child in front. They form the dragon’s body.
	 The single student stands facing the others – 
they are the dragon’s head.
	 On a command from the play leader, the dragon’s 
head tries to tag the dragon’s tail. The body of the 
dragon tries to stop this from happening by moving back and  
forwards between the head and the tail. They must remain joined at all times. The 
first person in the line may not grab the dragon’s head to stop them reaching the tail, nor use their arms to obstruct the head.
	 When the head tags the tail, the head joins the beginning of the line and the tail becomes the head. Then the game starts again. If a group is having difficulty tagging they may just swap after a designated time.
    
A variation of this game is ‘Head and tail’ , where there is no independently-moving ‘dragon’s head’ . Instead the child at the front of the line of children has to catch the child at the back of the tail.
