REQUIREMENTS
All games last for two equal halves of 45 minutes. At lower levels, especially in youth/children’s football, the halves may be shorter. Both halves 
must be the same length.
Where teams want to have shorter halves (because of fading light, a late kick-off, etc.), both teams and the referee must agree on how long the 
two halves will last before the game starts. The change must be in accordance with competition rules and should be reported to the competition 
organisers after the game.
The half-time break lasts for 15 minutes, although it may be shorter at lower levels, especially in youth/children’s football. The half-time interval 
can only be cancelled with the agreement of all players and the referee.
If the match is a draw at the end of normal time in a game that requires a winner, the competition rules will state if the game will:
• be decided by away goals
• go straight to penalties
• go to extra time (two equal halves, usually 15 minutes each, with a half-time break)
• go to penalties if the game is still drawn after extra time
There is a break before the start of extra time and before penalties.
At the end of each half (in normal time and extra time), the referee must add on all time lost through stoppages (additional time), in particular:
• substitutions
• injuries
• wasting time
• goal celebrations
• red and yellow cards
• drinks and cooling breaks
• delays for VAR checks and reviews
• other major delays, e.g. pitch invasion, floodlight failure, etc.
The fourth official (if there is one) uses the substitution board to show the amount of additional time decided by the referee. If there is no fourth 
official/substitution board, the referee should indicate the amount of additional time, usually with their fingers.
The referee:
• cannot reduce additional time once it has been decided
• must increase the additional time for any further time ‘lost’ through stoppages during the additional time itself
If a penalty kick is awarded at the end of a half, time must be allowed for the penalty kick to be taken. (see: Penalty kick)
WHAT HAPPENS IF…PLAYING TIMES
the referee blows the whistle too early at the end of a half but realises their mistake while still on the pitch?
The referee must resume the game and play the correct time.
the referee blows the whistle too early at the end of a half and does not realise their mistake until after they have left the pitch for 
the half-time interval?
