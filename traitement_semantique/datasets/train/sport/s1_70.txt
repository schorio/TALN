starting line as before. Children who are holding hands must not break hands – 
breaking the chain means the team is disqualified.
 This continues with the third child, the fourth child, etc. Whichever team gets back to the starting line with all the team-members holding hands together wins.
  
(Game adapted from Mithu and Chellaiah, 2003)
Safety issue: make sure that all children are aware of any child who is slower. The chain of children must move at the pace of the slowest child in the chain. In their excitement, children may have a tendency to ‘drag’ a less mobile child along which can result in a fall and injury.
1.2.2. Hula Hoop Relay
This relay race is really a variation of the centipede relay, but using a hoop instead of holding hands, and children seem to enjoy it more!
Materials 
 Hoops
 Markers or cones
 Whistle 
How to play
 Split the children into teams of equal numbers or abilities, 
maximum 5 children per team. Have the children stand in single-file lines.
 Give the first child in each team a hoop, which they loop over their hips.
 On the whistle, the first child from each team runs with the hoop around the cone and back to the starting line. Then the second child joins the first child inside the first hoop and they run once more around the cone together.
 Repeat this, each time adding one more child inside the hoop. The winning team is the team which returns to the start-line with all the team inside the hoop.
Safety issue: as with the centipede relay, there can be a tendency for children to get over-excited and forget that some children are slower than others! There’s a danger of children tripping and falling, especially when there are many children within the hoop. 
Therefore make sure that teams are not too large (this also depends on the size of the 
children).
