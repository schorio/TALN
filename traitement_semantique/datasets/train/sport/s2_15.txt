GOALKEEPERS
DEFINITION
Each team must have a goalkeeper (goalie/keeper) whose kit, especially the shirt, must be a different colour from the rest of their own team and 
the other team. If there is no goalkeeper, the game cannot continue.
WHAT CAN THEY DO?
A goalkeeper is allowed to:
• use their hands/arms to play the ball inside their own penalty area, except from a throw-in or backpass (deliberate kick) from a team-mate
• bounce or throw the ball in the air
• wear additional equipment, e.g. gloves, cap, tracksuit bottoms
• take part in normal play outside their penalty area (without using their hands/arms)
• take a throw-in, goal kick, corner kick, free kick, penalty kick or dropped ball
• hold the ball for no more than six seconds, after gaining control* of it with their hands
• change places with another player, as long as the referee is informed and the change occurs when the game is stopped
*The goalkeeper is considered to be in control of the ball with their hand(s) when:
• touching it with any part of the hand/arm, except during a save or an attempt to prevent the ball going into or near their goal
• holding it with their hand(s)
• bouncing it on the ground or throwing it in the air
• it is between their hands and/or any surface (e.g. ground or own body)
The goalkeeper cannot be challenged by an opponent when in control of the ball with their hand(s).

A goalkeeper is not allowed to:
• touch the ball with their hands/arms outside their penalty area

 >deliberately kicks it to them (backpass)

• touch the ball with the hand/arm after releasing it from their hands (this does not include after making a save) and before it has touched another 
player

• score a goal with their hands/arms against the other team
