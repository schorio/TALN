TIME
Although most beneﬁt obtained from sport is the pleasure from the
immediate consumption of the sports product, either as spectator orparticipant, some beneﬁts, particularly that of health, are more long-term in nature and can be enjoyed well after the activity itself: In theshort term the time at which sporting activities are scheduled can
affect participation and spectator levels. The emergence of Saturday
afternoons free from work for most people in the late nineteenthcentury paved the way for the emergence of commercialised sport byproviding it with a regular time slot, though it should be noted thatShefﬁeld Wednesday gained its name from that being the half-day onwhich many businesses closed in the nineteenth century. However,the traditional Saturday afternoon football ﬁxture has now beenaltered at the elite level to suit television.
TOBACCO
The evidence is overwhelming that both tobacco and alcohol are
injurious to health, yet both have sought to link themselveswith sport, usually considered to be health promoting. Unlikealcohol, tobacco has never been promoted as a beneﬁt to sports-
persons, though the tobacco trade, like the alcohol industry, has been
heavily involved in sports sponsorship, for example Benson andHedges in cricket and Marlboro in motor sport. Indeed, tobaccocompanies were the largest sponsors of sport in Britain until 1997when government legislation banned tobacco advertising at sports
events.TOBACCO
