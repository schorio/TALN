1.3.2. Blanketball
This game is related to volleyball, but with greater cooperation between 
the players and less mobility required. It can be conducted just as a fun activity or it can be made competitive.
Materials
 Blankets, sheets, or large towels
 Volleyball net, rope or chunnam powder (to mark 
playing area)
How to play
 Organise children into teams, 4 per team is best. If there are few children they can play in pairs
 Give each team a blanket or bed-sheet for each team. One child holds each corner of the blanket. A large towel would work if children are playing in pairs.
 Teams begin by playing with a ball each. Working together, they toss the ball in the air and catch it in the blanket. Have a competition to see who can toss and catch the highest!
 Each team then gets together with another team. Using one ball, they cooperate to toss and catch the ball between teams.
 Finally, using a barrier (for example, net, rope or just a line on the floor) and basic court, the teams play a competitive game. Teams toss the ball over the barrier and score if their opponents fail to catch the ball or throw the ball ‘out’ .
