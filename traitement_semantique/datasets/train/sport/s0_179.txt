Pedagogic theory brings the work of such renowned individuals as
Skinner, Piaget, Dewey and Maslow within the remit of physicaleducationalists, and represents a signiﬁcant departure from physicaltraining in that the development of the whole person is acknowl-
edged as important, rather than simply a series of competent physical
responses.

PERIODISATION
If it is to be effective, any training programme needs to be based onsound physical and psychological principles. The ‘periodisation oftraining’ is a means of employing systematic and progressive increasesin workloads, both physical and psychological, thereby promoting theoptimal adaptation to training. According to Dick (2002) such adap-tive processes should emphasise the following ordering of emphasis intraining: general endurance, aerobic endurance, anaerobic endur-
ance, strength, speed , and skill. Further work needs to be done in
matching psychological training principles to these physical trainingprinciples in order to ensure optimal effectiveness.

PHILOSOPHY
The philosophical study of sport and physical activity is a relatively
young ﬁeld. It has emerged largely as the result of efforts by twogroups of individuals: those in physical education and sport studieswho have been interested in analysing their ﬁeld from a philosophicalperspective; and, those trained in philosophy who have shown inter-est in subjecting sport, human movement, games and play, as sig-niﬁcant and meaningful human activities, to philosophical analysis.The ﬁrst major contribution to the area was Paul Weiss’ Sport: A
Philosophic Inquiry (1969). In December 1972, a small number of
individuals representing these two groups met and formed the Phi-
losophic Society for the Study of Sport. Since 1974, the society haspublished the Journal of the Philosophy of Sport , which is one of the
most important sources for those interested in the philosophical studyof sport and physical activity.PHILOSOPHY
