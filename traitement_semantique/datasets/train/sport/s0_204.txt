REPETITION TRAINING
Repetition training is a specialised form of interval training in which
the work phase of the training session is as near exhaustive as possible
and the recovery phase is lengthened so as to be almost complete.
Thus a 400-metre swimmer might undertake two 300-metre swimsat full pace but with a full recovery between the two, as opposed toan interval session in which the time between the two would bepredetermined and limited.

REPRODUCTION THESIS
The reproduction thesis replaced the reﬂection thesis as the major
vehicle for studies of sports sociology , and dominated the research
agenda in the decade from the mid-1970s. The reproduction thesisargued that sport, rather than merely reﬂecting the dominant themesof society, actively reproduced them. Sport can therefore be under-
stood as a location for the production and reproduction of the social
formations and social inequalities that exist within society. Theresearch methodology shifted with the changing theoretical approach,and empirical studies were replaced by analyses of labour patterns,race discrimination and resource availability. Such work demonstratedthat inequities in general society, for example between black andwhite worker salaries, were replicated in the sporting environment.

RESIDUAL VOLUME
After maximal deep expiration the amount of air that remains in thelungs is labelled the residual volume. In a healthy person this isaround 26 per cent of total lung capacity, independent of body posi-
tion. Between the ages of 25 and 30 the proportion can increase to
30–35 per cent due to increasing thoracic rigidity and a loss of elas-ticity in the lung tissue.REPETITION TRAINING
