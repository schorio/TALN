DEFINITION
The penalty area (box) is the larger rectangular area of the pitch. Two boundary lines are drawn at right angles to the goal line, 16.5 m (18 yds) from 
the inside of the goalposts. These lines extend into the pitch for 16.5 m (18 yds) and are joined by a line running parallel with the goal line. A penalty 
spot is marked 11 m (12 yds) from the middle of the goal. A semi-circle line is drawn outside the penalty area, 9.15 m (10 yds) from the penalty spot.PENALTY AREA
