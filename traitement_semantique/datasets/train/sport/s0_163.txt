school education had become virtually mandatory for the upper
middle classes, thus ensuring the widespread acceptance and inﬂuenceof muscular Christianity. The English public school system drewcomfort and conﬁdence from this ideology, which also helped ensure
its future. The ideology was to become an inoculation against
potential threats to religious belief, bodily health, social stability andnational prestige. Within muscular Christian discourse, the male bodyis often used as a metaphor for social, national and religious bodies,with the underlying frame of reference of a body’s constitution,adding to the depth of metaphor.
In a world where the certainties of creationism were challenged by
the writings of Charles Darwin, where the technological advances of the
industrial revolution undermined the bucolic beauties of an agrarian
society, and the development of cities led to the loneliness of thecrowd and the disruption of the traditional ties of the rural community,the search for a strong muscular Christian hero who could displayChristian manliness in the face of such onslaughts was perhapsinevitable. Victorian patriarchy ensured that the hero would be male;concerns about class and ruling-class power ensured that the herowould be a ‘gentleman’; the need to sustain an imperial identity ensured
that the hero would be British. The public schools ensured the supply
of a stream of muscular Christians to carry the ideology abroad.

MUSEUMS
In the light of how passionate sports fans are for their teams and
players, it is perhaps surprising how few sports museums actually
exist. A great deal of nostalgia surrounds sport, and while high pricesare paid for items of memorabilia, individual sports associations andclubs have often been hesitant to invest the large sums of moneynecessary to build a museum. Those museums that do exist areusually based around one of three themes: the player, the stadium orMUSEUMS
