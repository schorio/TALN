DEFINITION
Depending on the seriousness of the injury, the referee must make sure an injured player is assessed and, if necessary, treated as soon as possible.
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN
If a player is injured, the referee should stop the game if the injury is, or appears to be, serious. If a player is, or appears to be, only slightly injured, 
the referee allows play to continue.
An injured player can be assessed on the pitch but should not be treated on the pitch unless it is a serious injury.
A player who is assessed or treated on the pitch must then leave, except when:
• a goalkeeper is injured
• a goalkeeper and an outfield player collide with each other and need attention
• players from the same team collide and need attention
• a player is injured by a foul for which the offender is shown a red or yellow card
• a penalty kick has been awarded and the injured player will take the kick
A player who leaves the pitch after assessment/treatment may only return to the pitch after play has restarted and the referee has signalled for the 
player to do so. If the game is stopped, the player can return to the pitch from the goal line or touchline, but if the ball is in play, the player can only
return to the pitch from the touchline.
If the referee stops play for an injury and no offence has occurred, play restarts with a dropped ball (see: Dropped ball).
The referee must include the time taken for an injury in ‘additional time’ at the end of each half.
