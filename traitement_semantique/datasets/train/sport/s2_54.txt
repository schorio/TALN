DEFINITION
Handball is the illegal contact with or touch of the ball with the hand(s) and/or arm(s). However, it is not automatically a handball offence every 
time the ball touches a player’s hand/arm.
A handball offence is when a player (except the goalkeeper in their own penalty area):
• deliberately touches the ball with their hand/arm
• touches the ball with their hand/arm when it is in a position that makes their body unnaturally bigger and when that position is not the result 
of their body moving fairly as part of play
• scores a goal against the other team with their hand/arm or scores immediately after the ball touches their hand/arm (even if the touch was 
accidental)
*The hand and the arm below the bottom of the armpit are the parts of the body used for a possible handball offence.
A handball is punished with a direct free kick (or a penalty if the handball offence occurs in the player’s own penalty area).
Goalkeepers are allowed to use their hands/arms to touch, catch and hold the ball in their own penalty area, except in some situations e.g. a 
backpass or throw-in (see: Goalkeepers).HANDBALL
