the body in motion (dynamics) and in equilibrium (statics), and pro-
vides both descriptive (kinematic) and force (kinetic) analysis of
human movement. Applying biomechanical analysis in sport and
physical education generally takes one or more of three forms:
teaching fundamental movements; improving performance techni-
ques; and/or remediating or re-establishing movement patterns afterillness or injury.

BLOOD PRESSURE
Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of the body through the
arteries. Blood pressure is the force of the blood pushing against thewalls of the arteries. It is at its highest when the heart beats and iscalled systolic pressure, and then drops when the heart is at rest (i.e.between beats) and is called the diastolic pressure. Blood pressure is
measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and is expressed as sys-
tolic pressure/diastolic pressure. Normal pressure is 120/80 mmHg.Physical activity increases systolic blood pressure and can typicallyreach 200 mmHg with heavy endurance exercise. By contrast dia-stolic pressure changes little with exercise. Normal pressures above140/90 mmHg are considered to be indicators of hypertension.

BODY
Studies of the body, and its importance within sport and physicalexercise, have become increasingly important since the late 1980s.Researchers across a range of different disciplines realised that thebody could no longer be considered an unchanging and constant fact,
but was something that had to be assessed within the context of its
social and cultural setting. Historically and contemporarily, it has nowbeen realised that the body is deﬁned and constructed by its socialsetting. Therefore our understanding of the female body, and itscapacity to participate in sport, is radically different at the beginningof the twenty-ﬁrst century, to how it was conceived a hundred yearsBODY
