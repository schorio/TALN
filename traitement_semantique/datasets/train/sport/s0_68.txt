CRIMINAL LAW
In contrast to civil law , where an aggrieved individual or group sues
for redress, the initiative for prosecution under criminal law lies with
the agencies of the state. Hence it is the police who can bring chargesof assault against a violent player, with of course penal sanctions as apossible punishment.

CRITICAL THEORY
Primarily concerned with power in social life, critical theory hasemerged from the debates that centred on the respective merits ofconﬂict theory andfunctionalism . Those studying critical theory
are not normally seeking to assess the whole of society, but prefer to focuson particular problems. The deﬁnition of power is far broader than that
allowed for in conﬂict theory , and is not so dependant upon an
appreciation of power as a product of economic determinism. In the realm
of sport, critical theory seeks to understand how sports are shapedand inﬂuenced by the interaction of social relations. Proactively, itseeks to identify alternative sport forms that would better serve theneeds of people than those that currently exist. As such, critical theoryis popular amongst those wishing to promote groups of people suchas women or ethnic minorities, that are currently marginalised by sport.
