DEFINITION
A foul is an unfair physical offence committed against an opponent, usually with the foot/leg or hand/arm but sometimes with other parts of the 
body.
Offences that are not committed against an opponent are not fouls, e.g. handball, offside, etc.
Most fouls are punished with a direct free kick being awarded to the other team. However, most fouls involving no contact with the opponent result 
in an indirect free kick being awarded to the other team.
There are different disciplinary actions for different categories of fouls:
No card
• Careless
 >Non-intentional/routine foul that does not show consideration/care for the opponent
Yellow card
• Reckless
 >Quite serious foul that could cause a risk of injury to the opponent
• Stopping a promising attack (SPA)
 >Tactical foul that stops a promising attack – the seriousness of the foul does not matter
Red card
• Excessive force/serious foul play
 >Intense foul that endangers the safety of the opponent and creates a risk of serious injury
• Denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO)
 >Tactical foul that stops a very clear chance to score – the seriousness of the foul does not matter
• Violent conduct
 >Intense foul with a lot of force that occurs away from the ball
 >Does not involve trying to play the ball, e.g. punching, kicking, head-butting
 >If it occurs after play has stopped, then it is not a foul and a free kick cannot be given, but the player must still be shown a red card
What fouls are punished with a direct free kick?
The following fouls are punished with a direct free kick if committed against an opponent in a way that is considered careless, reckless or using 
excessive force:
• unfairly charging/bumping
• jumping at
• kicking or trying to kick
• pushing
• hitting/striking or trying to hit/strike (including a head-butt)
• unfairly tackling/challenging
• tripping or trying to trip
The following fouls are also punished with a direct free kick, but no judgement of carelessness, recklessness or excessive force is necessary; they 
may be offences that stop a promising attack (SPA) or deny an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO):
• holding an opponent
• playing dangerously* e.g. high foot (with contact)FOULS
