 When the whistle blows all the children have to run and stand on the blanket. Any 
children who are unable to are ‘out. ’
 Fold the blanket in half so that the area is half the size, and repeat the game. This time many children will be unable to fit on the blanket and will be ‘out. ’
 Repeat as many times as you are able to fold the blanket, reducing the standing area each time. The winning children are those who are standing on the blanket the final time.
Safety issue: there can be a lot pushing and shoving as the blanket gets smaller, so make sure that younger or less able children don’t get hurt.
Adaptations
 Allow children who are slower or less mobile to move within the circle, closer to 
the blanket.
 Play the game with all children hopping or jumping, while the child with mobility impairment can run.

How to play
	 Divide the children into pairs. The pairs hook elbows with each other, except for 
one pair, one of whom is “it” , and the other is the runner. 
	 The runner must hook elbows with any pair before being tagged by the ‘it’ child. 
The child on the other end of the pair which the runner hooked on to is now the runner.
	 If the runner is tagged, he exchanges roles with the ‘it’ child. The new ‘it’ child tries to tag the runner before he hooks onto a pair.
Adaptations
If a child with mobility impairment is ‘it’ , restrict the area in which the runner can run, to 
make it easier for ‘it’ to catch him. Or allow the ‘it’ child to tag the runner by throwing a ball at him rather than physically touching him.
