CAPTAINS
DEFINITION
Each team is led by a captain who usually wears an armband for identification.
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN?
The captains should take responsibility for the behaviour of their team-mates, encouraging them to play fairly and show respect towards the match 
officials and their decisions. However, they cannot be shown a red or yellow card for offences committed by a team-mate.
The captains have no special privileges to protest or argue with the referee or other match officials.
Both captains take part in the coin toss:
• before kick-off, to determine who kicks off and which goal to attack
• before penalties, to determine who takes the first kick and which goal will be used
