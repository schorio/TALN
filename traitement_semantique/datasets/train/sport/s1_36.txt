sport, eg. in wheelchair sports such as wheelchair 
tennis or wheelchair basketball, athletes with and without disabilities both use wheelchairs. This can also be called ‘reverse inclusion’ , where athletes without disabilities play sports which are normally for athletes with disabilities only.
Boccia (see above) can be another example 
of ‘adapted sport integrated’ . Boccia is a sport which was developed specifically for people with disabilities, but it can equally well be played in mixed teams of people with and without disabilities.5. Adapted sport segregated –  this is the final 
level of the Continuum of Inclusion. It is where athletes with disabilities participate in adapted sport in a completely segregated setting, without 
participation of athletes without disabilities. 
Examples of adapted sports are shown above:
Even if children with disabilities are playing an 
adapted or disability sport, with no children without disabilities participating at all, there can still be some degree of inclusion. For example, parallel events/tournaments can be held, eg. 
a wheelchair basketball match/tournament 1. Boccia, a target game similar to petanque which was designed 
for wheelchair-users
2. Para Badminton, which has categories for wheelchair-users as 
well as leg and arm amputees
3. Sitting Volleyball, for people with spinal injury or leg amputation4. Amputee football – 7-a-side football where the 6 outfield players 
are leg amputees and the goalkeeper is an arm amputee
5. Goalball – a sport which features in the Paralympic Games, 
specially developed for players with visual impairment 
6. Sitting Throwball – a variation of throwball, where all the children 
play seated on the ground, which is easier for children with mobility 
difficulties
