PLAYING TIMES
The referee must resume the game after the half-time interval without changing sides and play the correct time of the first half. The teams 
then change sides, and the game is restarted with the kick-off for the second half.
the playing conditions are not very good, and the half-time interval needs to be shortened in order to complete the game?
This is allowed if both teams and the referee agree.
a match goes to extra time?
The same principles apply as in normal time (both halves are the same duration, there is a half-time break and the referee allows additional 
time at the end of each half).
the half is extended for a penalty kick to be taken or retaken?
The half ends when the referee stops play for an offence by the attacking team or when the ball:
• goes into the goal
• stops moving (including being held by the goalkeeper)
• rebounds off the goalkeeper, goalpost(s), crossbar or corner flagpost and has no chance of going into the goal
• goes out of play
• is touched after the kick by any player (except the defending goalkeeper)
