Safety issues: Modify the type, duration and intensity of activity according to the age 
and ability of the participants. Ensure that the equipment is of a suitable size/weight for the participants. Be particularly aware of safety when using heavy equipment such as dumb-bells. Children and youth can get carried away and push themselves 
beyond their own limits. Circuit training is supposed to be an individual activity – 
make sure that children do not get too competitive and compare themselves with each other, as this can lead to injuries.
