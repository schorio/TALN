DEFINITION
Obstruction, or impeding the progress of an opponent, is when a player unfairly uses their body to prevent an opponent from getting to and/or 
playing the ball.
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN?
Every player has a right to their position on the pitch.
A player can use their body to shield the ball from an opponent in order to make it difficult for the opponent to get to the ball, as long as the ball is 
within playing distance*. A player who is shielding the ball is allowed to be fairly charged (shoulder-to-shoulder) by an opponent.
*Playing distance means that the player could touch the ball if they stretched their foot/leg or jumped (including hands/arms for goalkeepers).
If a player obstructs an opponent, the referee awards:
• a direct free kick if there is contact with the opponent
• an indirect free kick if there is no contact
