WHAT HAPPENS IF…HANDBALL
a player is falling and the ball hits their supporting arm, which is between their body and the ground?
This is not handball (unless the ball goes directly into the opponents’ goal or the player scores immediately afterwards, in which case a 
direct free kick is awarded to the other team).
a player is hit on the hand/arm by the ball from a team-mate’s kick/header?
This is not handball (unless the ball goes directly into the opponents’ goal or the player scores immediately afterwards, in which case a 
direct free kick is awarded to the other team).
a player heads/kicks the ball and it then hits their own hand/arm?
This is not handball (unless the ball goes directly into the opponents’ goal or the player scores immediately afterwards, in which case a 
direct free kick is awarded to the other team).
a player prevents the ball from going into their own goal with their hand/arm but does not deliberately handle the ball and 
does not make their body unnaturally bigger?
This is not handball.
a player tries to score with their hand/arm?
A direct free kick is awarded to the other team and a yellow card is shown to the offending player (even if the attempt to score is unsuccessful).
