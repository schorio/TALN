In Change to Include, all the children of different 
abilities do the same activity but with adaptations. The purpose of the adaptations is to provide support to those with less abilities, and challenge 
to those with more abilities. The types of 
adaptations which can be made follow the STEP 
model (space, task, equipment and people). Chapter 4 gives examples of this. In the game pictured, for example (running and picking up marker saucers), a child with mobility impairment can be allowed to run a shorter distance.
In Ability Groups, children are grouped according to ability. Each group does a version of the same activity, but at a level which suits the individuals in each group. For example more able children might be involved in a game of full-contact football, while children with less ability would be involved in a passing or dribbling game or activity.
You might also use this approach in a group with 
children of mixed ages. In the picture bottom left, a very diverse group of children is divided into two groups – smaller children play a minor game (passing a ball between the legs), while older boys are instructed in a more physical ball-throwing game.
 
This is similar to Ability Groups: children with disabilities work individually on specific skills, to enable them to be successfully included in the whole group. This approach is used when a 
child needs to practise separately first before 
participating in the main group. For example a child might need additional practice in catching or developing hand-eye coordination before participating in a sport such as cricket. This approach should only be used temporarily and not most of the time. 
 
This is the same as ‘Adapted sport integrated’ in the Continuum of Inclusion, where children without disabilities play with children with disabilities in adapted or disability sports, eg. sitting throwball 
or boccia.
