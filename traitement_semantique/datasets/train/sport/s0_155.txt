MODERN SPORT
Allen Guttmann has provided a seven-category model with which todistinguish modern sport from that of previous eras. First comessecularism , by which any religious connotations of sport have been
jettisoned and sport is played not to make the earth more fertile but
for more personal and social reasons. Second, he postulates that another
characteristic of modern sport is equality . This is in two senses: that
theoretically everyone should have the opportunity to compete, and
that the conditions of competition should be the same for all con-testants. Third is specialisation , in which players within teams have
sharply deﬁned roles unlike in, say, folk football, where there were no
speciﬁc defenders or attackers. This specialisation emanates from themodern emphasis on achievement in sport. Fourth, sport has become
rationalised , with rules rather than customs and with the use of
sports science to improve performance. Fifth, there has been the
development of extensive, bureaucratic organisations to establish uni-versal rules and oversee their implementation. The sixth aspect is thatof an obsession with quantiﬁcation and a detailing of statistical infor-mation. Finally, and following on from quantiﬁcation, is the quest forrecords within sport so that athletes can aim to be faster, higher andstronger.
