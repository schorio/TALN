STRIKES AND INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES
Players and administrators may work for the same club and wish it
to be successful on the ﬁeld of play. Nevertheless, not all theirobjectives and ambitions may coincide. The former may want to bepaid their economic rent , whereas the administrators may pay
more attention to balancing the books. Sometimes the dispute may
be with the controlling association rather than with the employing
club on matters that affect the labour force as a whole rather thanone club or team in particular. Disputes in British sport have gen-erally been of the ﬂashpoint variety. Instances of jockeys refusing toride at a particular meeting because they felt conditions were dan-gerous, or players not turning out because they had not been paidare more common than any premeditated national campaign by asports union, such as the threat of the Professional Footballers’
Association to hold national strikes over the maximum wage and
theretain and transfer system prior to the First World War, and
over the distribution of television revenues in the 1990s. In the
United States whole seasons have been disrupted by industrialaction.

STROKE VOLUME
This is a measure of cardiac output, basically of the amount of bloodpumped out of the heart with each beat. It is controlled by a com-bination of hormones, the nervous system, and the amount of bloodreturning to the heart. During exercise the muscle pump also helps tomaintain stroke volume which can increase up to twofold. In a
normal healthy heart the stroke volume is the same for both sides of
the heart, about 70 ml.
