DEFINITION
Direct and indirect free kicks are awarded to the opposing team for offences committed by players, substitutes, substituted players, sent-off 
players or team officials.
A direct free kick offence committed in the offending player’s penalty area results in a penalty kick being awarded.
A goal can be scored from a direct free kick without another player touching the ball.
A goal can only be scored from an indirect free kick if, before entering the goal, the ball touches another player.
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN?
Once a free kick has been awarded, if it is an indirect free kick, the referee raises one arm above the head and keeps it in this position until the 
kick has been taken and:
• the ball goes out of play or touches another player
• there is no possibility of the ball going directly into the goal
Free kicks are taken from the place where the offence occurred except:
• for an offence committed in the goal area:
 >a free kick for the defending team can be taken from anywhere in the goal area
 >an indirect free kick for the attacking team is taken on the line of the goal area that is parallel to the goal line closest to where the offence 
occurred
• for the offence of leaving, entering or re-entering the pitch without permission, the free kick is taken from the position of the ball when play 
was stopped
• for an offence committed off the pitch, the free kick is taken on the boundary line closest to where the offence occurred (if it is a direct free kick 
offence in the offending player’s penalty area, a penalty kick is awarded)
When a free kick is taken:
• the ball:
 >must be stationary (not moving)
 >is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves
• until the ball is in play, all opponents must remain:
 >at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball, unless they are on their own goal line between the goalposts (in cases where there is an indirect free 
kick closer than 9.15 m (10 yds) to the goal line)
 >outside the penalty area for a free kick inside the opponents’ penalty area
• if the defending team make a defensive wall of three players of more, all attacking team players must be at least 1 m (1 yd) from the wall until 
the ball is in play
• the kicker cannot touch the ball again until another player has touched it
WHAT HAPPENS IF…FREE KICKS
a direct free kick goes into the opponents’ goal without another player touching it?
A goal is awarded.
