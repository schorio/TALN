ANIMAL RIGHTS
Activists for animal rights argue for the dissolution of the ethical
boundaries separating people from animals, thus mandating the
moral consideration of animals and their protection from human
exploitation. They question the morality of sportspeople whointeract with animals, not merely in hunting, shooting and ﬁshing,but in show-jumping, sheepdog trials and pigeon racing. In thenineteenth century some brutal animal sports such as cockﬁght-
ing and bull baiting were made illegal, but this owed more toattempts to civilise the urban working class than to the precursorsof the modern animal rights movement, the antivivisectionists.
There are three strands within the animal rights activists: the wel-
farists who believe that animals deserve compassion and protection
but allow that there are some boundaries between species; thepragmatists who argue that animals deserve moral and legal con-
sideration, with a balance between human and animal interests, andwho accept that there is some hierarchy of animals; and the fun-damentalists who believe that animals have absolute moral and legalrights to autonomy with equal rights for all species. Obviously
their goals and strategies vary. The welfarists aim to avoid cruelty
and thus support reformist legislation and humane education; thepragmatists wish to avoid all unnecessary animal suffering but areprepared to negotiate and accept short-term compromise; the fun-
damentalists seek total and immediate abolition of animal exploita-
tion and are prepared to use direct action and civil disobedience tosupport their protests.

ANIMAL SPORTS
Animals have featured in sport as combatants, as prey, and as perfor-mers. Most of the ﬁrst category have now been outlawed but, fromthe seventeenth- to the early nineteenth centuries, bull, bear and
badger baiting, where dogs were set on a staked animal, were part of
the sporting scenery. Cockﬁghting and matches between viciousdogs, often to the death, also offered opportunities for wagering andANIMAL SPORTS
