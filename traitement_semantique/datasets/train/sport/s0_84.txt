ENERGY METABOLISM
Metabolism refers to all of the chemical reactions that occur in the
body in the production of energy for work. Since our bodies cannot
use foods in the form that we ingest them, they must be broken
down into forms usable as energy by the cells. In breaking down
food, the body manufactures adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ), which is
stored in all cells and is the source of energy for all biological func-tions from muscular contractions to cellular growth. The process ofturning food components in a cell into usable energy is described bytheKrebs cycle or citric acid cycle.

ENERGY SYSTEMS
The body has three energy systems. T wo of the systems, the adenosine
triphosphate-phosphocreatine system ( ATP -PC) and the glycolysis
system are anaerobic because they do not require oxygen to sustain
the chemical reactions that manufacture ATP . The third or oxidativeenergy system is aerobic and thus does require oxygen for the trans-duction of energy. The two anaerobic systems supply only limitedamounts of ATP . During high-intensity, short-term exercise typicallylasting twenty-seconds or less, energy production is dominated by theATP-PC system. For intense exercise lasting longer than forty-ﬁve
seconds all three systems combine to produce the needed ATP to fuel
muscular activity. The energy to perform prolonged exercise of morethan ten minutes’ duration comes primarily from the aerobic system.

ENGINEERING
The application of science to sport via engineering is a relatively newacademic discipline, though it has been practised for a long time inthe production and improvement of sports equipment. Examples of theway it has altered sports technology include the shifting of the centre
of mass of the javelin to restrict the length of its ﬂight so as to lessen theENERGY METABOLISM
