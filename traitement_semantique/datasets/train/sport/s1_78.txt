Adaptations
If there is a child with a mobility impairment in the group, ensure that she can compete 
equally with the other children; eg. when returning to the gap in the circle, the other 
child must walk, or count to three after saying ‘Good Morning’ , or allow the child with 
disability to take a short cut across the circle instead of around it, etc.

 Marker saucers, Whistle
How to play
One of the children is selected as ‘it’ and the others spread out in 
a play area (the size depends on the number of children). On the whistle, the child who is ‘it’ chases and tries to tag other children. A child who is tagged joins hands with the ‘it’ child. The two children run and try to tag others, and each tagged child joins the chain. The 
last child to be tagged is the winner.
A variation of this game is Chain Nindi Tag (Hopping Tag). The child 
who is ‘it’ chases and tries to tag the other children by hopping on one foot. A child who are tagged join the ‘it’ child by putting her hand on the shoulder of the ‘it’ child, and both children hop and tag others together. All children who are tagged must join the chain and tag others.
Adaptations
Adaptations to ‘level’ the game for mixed abilities include:
 Giving a child with disability several ‘lives’ after being tagged.
 When the child with disability is ‘it’ the game is played walking 
rather than running
 A child with disability tags other children by throwing a ball at them rather than actually touching them.
