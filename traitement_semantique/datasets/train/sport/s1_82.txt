1.5.8. Meo Maya
Materials 
 Marker saucers
How to play
 A game for ten children. Divide the children 
into two teams – one is the Meo team and the other is the Maya team.
 Line up the two teams along two parallel lines about 3 metres apart. Behind each of these lines, mark two other parallel lines 5 metres away.
 The play leader calls out at random either ‘Meo’ or ‘Maya. ’ If the play leader calls out ‘Meo’ , the Meo players chase the Maya players up to the Maya’s back-line and try to tag them. If Meo players manage to tag 3 players they score 3 and Maya scores 2. If Meo players tag 4 players they score 4 and Maya scores 1, etc.
Adaptations
 Decrease/increase the distance that children have to run, according to their ability.
 Simplify the game for younger children by waiving the scoring system. Children who are tagged are simply ‘out’ , and continue playing until there is only one child left.
1.5.9. In the pond on the bank
A very gentle, easy game which can be used an ice-breaker or a warm-up activity.
Materials
 Marker saucers
How to play
 The children form a circle which is marked by marker saucers. When the play leader 
calls out ‘in the pond’ , all the children take a jump into the circle. If the play leader then calls ‘on the bank’ , all the children jump back out of the circle again. If the play leader calls out ‘in the pond’ when they are already in the pond, the children stay 
where they are and don’t move. If anyone moves by mistake, they are ‘out. ’
Adaptation
 Children using wheelchairs push themselves into the pond or onto the bank, 
depending on the play leader’s call.
