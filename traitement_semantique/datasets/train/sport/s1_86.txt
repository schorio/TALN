1.6.3. Play parachutes
A play parachute is not a common piece of play equipment in Sri Lanka, although they 
are increasing in popularity. They are extremely attractive to children (both with and without disabilities), because of their large size, bright colours and movement (although because they are so novel, some children may initially feel somewhat reluctant to use 
them). They are versatile pieces of equipment which can be used to play a number 
of games which are described below, both cooperative and competitive. A large number of children can play at the same time, depending on the size of the parachute – they come in different sizes, with an average size play parachute accommodating 30 children. 
Games you can play with a play parachute include:
Parachute crossing - Give the children a number or name (eg. of an animal, a fruit, etc), 
so that there are two of each. Have all the children shake the parachute while standing, and then call out two names/numbers. Those two children have to duck under the parachute and swap places with one another.
Round and round - A simple cooperative ball game. Place one large ball on the 
parachute and all the 
children together have 
to manoeuvre the 
parachute (moving it up and down) so that the ball moves one full circuit around the edge of the parachute
Parachute goalball - 
Divide the players into two or three teams and spread each team evenly around the edge of the parachute. Put different coloured balls on the 
parachute, one for each team. Each team has to manoeuvre the parachute so that their 
ball drops down the centre hole.
Popcorn – place a large number of small balls on the parachute. On blowing the whistle, 
the children have the wave the parachute 
up and down, shaking off all the small balls as quickly as possible. The result resembles popcorn being popped in a frying pan and children find it very exciting!
