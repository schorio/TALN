Chapter  V
inclusive games and sports
T his chapter presents a number of games and sports which have been field-
tested during the Sports For All Project. The first section contains more 
informal, fun games, more suitable for play and leisure sessions such as children’s 
clubs, or as warm-up activities in PE lessons. The second section presents more formalised sports and games (codified with standard rules), including some internationally recognised sports, which are suitable for competitions in schools or sports clubs.
Explanations are given for why each game/sport is suitable for children with 
disabilities, or suggestions are given on how to make it more disability-inclusive.Dodge-ball, a perennial favourite game with childrenKey Learning
