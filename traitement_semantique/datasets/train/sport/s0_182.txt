PHYSICAL LITERACY
The term ‘physical literacy’ refers to the degree to which an indivi-
dual demonstrates competency in a range of movement forms andproﬁciency in various forms of physical activity. It also has a cognitivecomponent in that competent or proﬁcient movement, either alone
or within a group, constitutes an intellectual as well as a physical
response to a given situation or circumstance. In the current envir-onment of student proﬁling and assessment, physical literacy might besaid to be measurable against broadly framed sets of statements thatenable qualitative/quantitative measures to be recorded. For it to bemeaningful, the term must be inclusive – that is of all groups withincommunities – and should acknowledge the competence with whichindividuals master their interaction with their own particular envir-
onment. At a basic level, physical education attempts to develop
physical literacy in both natural and artiﬁcial environments in a way
that also builds social skills and conﬁdence, and encourages emotionalexpression and control.
