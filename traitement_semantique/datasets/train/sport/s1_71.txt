How to play
 Split the children into teams of even 
numbers, eg. 6, 8, or 10 children per team. Have the children stand in a single-file line of pairs behind the starting line.
 Give the leader of each line one balloon. The first pair of children from each team holds the balloon between their heads. On the whistle each team’s first pairs run or walk together around the cone then return to the start line.
 The first pair then passes the balloon to the second pair, who repeat this pattern until the balloon gets to the end of last partners. The first team to finish wins the game.
 Children are not allowed to use their hands at all during the game, except when passing the balloon from one pair to the next. If the balloon falls to the ground at any point, the children must return to the start-line.
 The balloon must be held head-to-head, without using the neck of shoulder.
Safety issues: very young children, or children with learning difficulties, may be scared by popping balloons. Fragments of popped balloons can also be a choking hazard.
