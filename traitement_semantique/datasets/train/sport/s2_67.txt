DEFINITION
Apart from fouls and handball, there are other offences that can result in a free kick (direct or indirect) being awarded and sometimes a red or 
yellow card being shown.
Many of these are technical offences, which are offences that are against the Laws of the Game rather than offences committed against an opponent.
DIRECT FREE KICK FOR...
• Entering or re-entering the pitch without the referee’s permission and interfering with the game or an opponent
INDIRECT FREE KICK FOR...
• Offside offences
• Verbal offences, especially arguing, protesting, swearing, etc.
• Verbally distracting an opponent (usually to put them off when they are trying to play the ball)
• Simulation/diving/exaggeration to get: 
 >a free kick or penalty kick
 >a red or yellow card for an opponent
• After taking a free kick, corner kick, goal kick, penalty kick, throw-in or kick-off, the player touches the ball again before another player has 
touched it
• Entering, leaving or re-entering the pitch without the referee’s permission but not interfering with the game or an opponent
• When an attacking team player is less than 1 m (1 yd) from a defensive ‘wall’ of three or more players when a free kick is taken
• If the goalkeeper:
 >holds the ball with their hand(s)/arm(s) for more than six seconds
 >touches the ball for a second time after releasing the ball, before it has touched another player (except after a save)
 >touches the ball with their hand(s)/arm(s) after it has been deliberately kicked to them by a team-mate (backpass)
 >touches the ball with their hand(s)/arm(s) after receiving it directly from a throw-in by a team-mate
• Using a deliberate trick to flick the ball up and play it to the goalkeeper to get round the backpass Law
• Illegally marking the pitch
• Behaving unfairly (unsportingly)
• Showing a lack of respect for the game and its participants
• At a penalty kick:
 >The kicker feints (pretends to kick the ball) at the end of their run-up, i.e. when their non-kicking/standing foot stops near the penalty spot
 >An attacker enters the penalty area before the kick is taken and the kick is missed / saved
 >The wrong player takes the kick
 >The penalty is kicked backwards
• The referee plays advantage when a player should have been sent off (red card or second yellow card) and the offending player then gets 
involved in the game
• A player commits an offence off the pitch against one of their own team-mates (including substitutes) or one of their own team officials
