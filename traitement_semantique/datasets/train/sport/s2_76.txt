DEFINITION
A red card is shown to someone when they are sent off. Red cards can be shown for offences by players, substitutes, substituted players, coaches 
and other team officials.
WHEN IT IS SHOWN
A person can be sent off from the time the referee goes onto the pitch for the pre-match inspection until the referee leaves the pitch after the end 
of the game, including during half-time, the break before extra time, extra time, half-time of extra time and penalties.
If a player commits a red-card offence before entering the pitch to start the game, no red card is shown but the player cannot play in the game 
and the incident is reported to the appropriate authorities after the game.
If the offence is committed:
• before the team lists are submitted – the player cannot be included on the team list and cannot take part in the game
• between the submission of the team lists and the kick-off – the player can be replaced by one of the substitutes, so the team starts with 11 
players. However, the substitute cannot be replaced but the team does not lose a substitution
A red card is shown if a player, substitute or substituted player:
• denies the other team a goal or obvious goal-scoring opportunity by committing:
 >handball (except for a goalkeeper in their own penalty area)
 >a foul (except when a penalty kick is awarded for a foul that was an attempt to play the ball, in which case a yellow card is shown)
 >any other offence
• commits serious foul play (serious/dangerous foul)
• is guilty of violent conduct (punching, kicking, head-butting, etc.)
• spits at or bites someone
• uses language or behaves in a way that is offensive, insulting or abusive
• receives a second yellow card in the same game
A red card is shown if a team official:
• delays the other team’s restart of the game, e.g. by holding onto the ball, kicking it away or obstructing an opponent
• leaves their bench/technical area or enters the pitch to argue with the referee or other match official
• acts aggressively or interferes with the game or a player from the other team
• enters the other team’s bench/technical area and behaves aggressively
• is guilty of violent conduct (punching, kicking, head-butting, etc.)
• spits at or bites someone
• throws/kicks something onto the pitch
• is shown a second yellow card in the same game
• uses language or behaves in a way that is offensive, insulting or abusive
• incorrectly uses electronic/communication equipment and behaves inappropriately as a result
If someone on the bench/in the technical area commits a red-card offence and cannot be identified, the head coach must be shown the red card 
(as the leader of the team and the person responsible for the people on the bench/in the technical area).
Red cards must be shown during a stoppage in the game and not while the ball is in play.
If the referee plays advantage following a red-card offence that denies the opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO), a yellow card 
is shown instead of a red card, as the advantage allowed the attack to continue.RED CARDS
