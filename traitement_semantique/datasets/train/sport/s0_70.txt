advertising , the major corporations and sports organisations have
been able to gain access to markets across the world, and people have
responded by transforming their points of cultural reference. In theCaribbean, for example, sporting dreams are no longer dominated by
images of test cricket, but instead hinge on playing major league
baseball or basketball in the United States. Men such as MichaelJordan are accepted as global sporting icons in countries such asAustralia or Britain, where basketball is far from being the top sport,but where companies such as Nike, who have used Jordan to spear-head advertising campaigns, have been successful in dominating themarketplace. Cultural imperialism takes many different forms, but itis a process that is active in the contemporary world, and one which,
with the increasing power of the media and the wealth of sporting
organisations such as the IOC or FIFA, continues to grow unabated.

CURRICULUM DESIGN
Curriculum design embraces the overall philosophy/purpose of a
course and the means by which this is to be implemented. Thisshould not simply address such issues as curriculum content and/orstructure, but should include an identiﬁcation of desired learningoutcomes and the learning experiences that might best facilitate thoseoutcomes. Curriculum design must also include the delivery process,
performance assessment, quality assurance, and a review process that
allows the identiﬁcation and implementation of necessary changes toany of its component parts without undue delay or wholesalerestructuring.
A curriculum design process might include:
/C15curriculum theory and structural model
/C15curriculum needs – both material and consultative
/C15identiﬁcation of learning outcomes
/C15course structure (and sequencing if more than one component/level)
/C15quality assurance
/C15approval and accreditation (internal and external)
