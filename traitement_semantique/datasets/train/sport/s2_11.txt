REQUIREMENTS
There must be a goal at each end of the pitch in the middle of the goal line. Goals consist of two vertical goalposts joined at the top by a crossbar, 
all of which must be white.
Goals for adults’ football must be 7.32 m (8 yds) wide and 2.44 m (8 ft) high. Smaller goals are allowed for youth/children’s football.
The posts and crossbar of both goals must be the same width (maximum 12 cm / 5 in) and shape (square, rectangular, round, elliptical or a mixture 
of these shapes). 
For safety reasons, all goals (including portable goals) must be securely fixed to the ground.
Nets are not compulsory, but if they are used, they must be fixed to the goalposts, crossbar and the ground, making sure that the goalkeeper has 
enough space to move.
If the crossbar breaks, it must be replaced or fixed. A rope or any other flexible or dangerous material cannot be used to replace the crossbar. 
Therefore, if it cannot be suitably replaced or fixed, the game must be abandoned.
Cameras and/or microphones are not allowed to be in or attached to the goalposts, crossbars or goal nets.GOALS
