mental health beneﬁts. Sadly, despite the compelling nature of this
evidence, many people are reluctant to take up exercise and physicalactivity; similarly many are easily dissuaded from adhering to it.Dishman (2001) has shown that only about 25 per cent of the adult
population of most industrialised countries exercise regularly and that
only 10 per cent of such populations exercise either sufﬁciently vig-orously or often enough to obtain signiﬁcant health and ﬁtnessbeneﬁts.

EXERCISE ADHERENCE
Commonly cited factors affecting exercise adherence include lack of
time, expense, loss of interest, poor instruction, inadequate support,physical discomfort, inconvenience, and even embarrassments. Assuch, researchers such as Dishman (1994) have recommended that
two categories of factors need to be addressed when planning exer-
cise programmes, if the chances of exercise adherence are to bemaximized: situation factors and personal factors. Among the criticalsituation factors which inﬂuence adherence are time, money, roleconﬂict, facilities, social support and exercising with others. Amongthe personal factors which inﬂuence adherence are personality, goalsand interest. Research suggests that individuals are more likely tomake exercise a regular part of their daily routine if these situational
and personal factors are appropriately addressed.

EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY
Exercise physiology is that branch of physiology which deals with
the functioning of the body during exercise, with the intent of
promoting a better understanding of the physical capabilities andlimitations of the human body and its underlying physiology.T ypically, researchers study functional responses to exercise in termsof a single bout of exercise (acute) or repeated exercise sessions(chronic). The effects of both acute and chronic exercise are alsoEXERCISE ADHERENCE
