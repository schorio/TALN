1.2.4. Ball passing
Limited movement is required in this game, which makes it suitable for children with 
difficulty walking.
Materials 
 Balls
 Whistle 
How to play
 Split the children into teams of equal numbers or abilities. Have the children stand 
in single-file lines.
 Give a ball to the child at the front of each line. On the whistle, each child at the front passes the ball backwards over her head to the child behind, who passes it to the child behind her, and so forth, until it reaches the end of the line.
 When the child at the back of the line receives the ball, he runs to the front of the line and starts the process again. The first team to complete the race (ie. all children have had a turn at the front of the line) is the winner.
 When passing the ball over their heads, the children are not allowed to turn and look at the child behind them.
 A variation of the game is that children pass the ball through their legs rather than over their heads.
Adaptations
A child with limited arm movement is allowed to 
turn the body to pass the ball, rather than using 
only her arms.
