DEFINITION
Playing distance refers to when a player can touch the ball if they stretch their foot/leg or jump. For a goalkeeper, it includes how far they can 
stretch their hand(s)/arm(s).

A player can use their body to shield the ball from an opponent if the ball is within playing distance and they do not use their hand/arm to hold 
off the opponent.
