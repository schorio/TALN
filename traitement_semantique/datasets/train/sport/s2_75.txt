• excessively shows the VAR review ‘TV signal’
• acts in a confrontational manner
• continually behaves unacceptably
• shows a lack of respect for the game or their opponents
If someone on the bench/in the technical area commits a yellow-card offence and cannot be identified, the head coach must be shown the yellow 
card (as the leader of the team and the person responsible for the people on the bench/in the technical area).
Yellow cards must be shown during a stoppage in the game and not while the ball is in play.
If the referee plays advantage for a yellow-card offence, the card must be shown when the game next stops. However, if the offence was stopping 
a promising attack (SPA), no card is shown, as the advantage allowed the promising attack to continue.
Details about all yellow cards must be reported after the game to the appropriate disciplinary authorities.
