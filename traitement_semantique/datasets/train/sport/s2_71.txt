PENALTY KICKS
DEFINITION
A penalty kick is awarded to the other team when a player commits a direct-free-kick offence (usually a foul or handball) inside their own penalty area.  
A goal can be scored directly from a penalty kick.
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN?
All players, except for the goalkeeper and the kicker, must be outside the penalty area and the semi-circle line (penalty arc), which is 9.15 m/10 
yds from the penalty spot. They cannot go inside the penalty arc or penalty area until the ball is in play (i.e. the ball is kicked and clearly moves).
The ball must be on the penalty spot and stationary (not moving).
The goalkeeper:
• must face the ball
• must be on the goal line and between the goalposts
• must not shake or be touching the goalposts, crossbar or goal net
• can move along the goal line and/or jump up and down, as long as at least part of each foot is on, above or behind the line
• can move off the goal line as the ball is kicked, as long as at least part of one foot is on or above the line
The kicker:
• must be clearly identified so the referee and the goalkeeper know who is taking the kick
• can stop and start during their run-up to the ball
• must not stop or feint (pretend to kick the ball) at the end of their run-up – they must kick it immediately
• must kick the ball forward (but can backheel it towards the goal)
• cannot touch the ball again until another player has touched it
The referee:
• checks the ball is on the penalty spot and makes sure all players are in the correct position
• blows the whistle for the kick to be taken
• carefully watches the kicker and the goalkeeper (the assistant referee will usually help by watching the goalkeeper and checking whether the 
ball crosses the goal line)
• allows the kick to be taken even if time is up at the end of the half
If the half is extended to allow a penalty kick to be taken, the half ends after the kick has been taken and when:
• the referee stops play for an offence committed by the attacking team, or the ball:
 >goes into the goal
 >stops moving (including being held by the goalkeeper)
 >rebounds off the goalkeeper, a goalpost, the crossbar or the corner flagpost and has no chance of going into the goal
 >goes out of play
 >is touched after the kick by any player (except the defending goalkeeper)
WHAT HAPPENS IF…
the ball is moving or is not on the penalty spot when the kick is taken?
Kick scored: The kick must be retaken. 
Kick missed / saved: The kick must be retaken.
