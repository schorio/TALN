• a person who is not a player, substitute, team official or match official (e.g. a spectator or ball boy/girl)
• an animal
• an object thrown by a spectator
• a structure, e.g. an overhanging branch
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN? 
The referee should try to make sure that any outside agent does not interfere with the game, the players, the referee or the other match officials.
When the game is stopped because of outside interference, play restarts with a dropped ball for the team that last touched the ball before the 
game was stopped (see: Dropped ball).
