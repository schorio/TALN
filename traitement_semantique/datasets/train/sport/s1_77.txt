 The other team stands inside the circle. The outside team get the ball and throw it 
at the team in the circle.
 When a player inside the circle is hit below the waist they are out. If a player inside the circle catches the ball, the thrower is out.
 The game continues until all the children inside the circle are out, then the two teams change places and the game starts again.
 The game can be played with one ball or more, depending on the number of children and the size of the circle.
Adaptations
A child with disability within the circle can be given several ‘lives’ before being out.
When throwing, children with disabilities can be allowed to step inside the circle. A 
‘helper’ could also help them to fetch thrown balls to enable them to actively participate in the game.

These games involve more physical movement, so be particularly aware of 
adaptations so that children with mobility impairments can take part and have an 
equal chance.

How to play
All the children except one form a circle about 10 metres in diameter. The one child who 
is ‘it’ runs outside the circle and taps on the back of one child and continues running. 
The tapped child runs in the opposite direction, and when the two children meet on the other side of the circle, they stop and shake hands saying “Good Morning” three times. They then dash to the 
gap in the circle; whichever child is slowest to get back to the gap 
becomes ‘it’ and the game continues. Make sure that all children get a chance to be ‘it’ .
