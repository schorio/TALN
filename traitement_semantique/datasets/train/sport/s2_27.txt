DEFINITION
A kick-off:
• starts each half of normal time
• starts each half of extra time
• restarts the game after a goal has been scored
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN?
Before the game starts, the referee calls the two captains together for the toss of a coin.
If the captain that wins the coin toss:
• chooses which goal to attack in the first half, the other team takes the kick-off
• chooses to kick off, the other captain will choose which goal to attack in the first half
The opponents of the team that takes the kick-off in the first half will take the kick-off in the second half.
The above procedure is followed again if the game goes to extra time.
If a team scores a goal, the other team takes the kick-off to restart the game.
At the kick-off:
• the ball must be stationary (not moving) on the centre spot
• all players must be on the pitch and in their own half, except the player taking the kick-off, who can be in the other team’s half
• the opponents of the team taking the kick-off must be at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball (i.e. outside the centre circle) until it is in play
• the referee gives a signal for the kick-off to take place
• the ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves
• a goal can be scored if the ball is kicked straight into the other team’s goal but not into the kicker’s own goal
• the kicker cannot touch the ball again until it has touched another player
WHAT HAPPENS IF…KICK-OFF
the ball is moving or not on the centre spot?
The kick-off is retaken.
one or more players (except the kicker) are not in their own half?
The kick-off is retaken.
a team kicks off after conceding a goal while the other team are off the pitch celebrating?
The kick-off is retaken, as all players must be on the pitch and in their own half.
