REQUIREMENTS
The pitch must be rectangular and marked with clear, unbroken lines, which are usually white but can be another colour.
All lines on the pitch are part of the area they enclose, e.g. if a foul/handball is committed by a defender on the penalty area line, it is considered 
as having occurred inside the penalty area and a penalty kick is awarded.
All lines must be of the same width, which must not be more than 12 cm (5 in).
The longer lines on the side of the pitch are the touchlines.
The shorter lines at the end of the pitch are the goal lines.
In adults’ football, the dimensions are:
• Touchline: 90 to 120 m (100 to 130 yds)
• Goal line: 45 to 90 m (50 to 100 yds)

The pitch dimensions for youth/children’s football may be smaller.
No advertising is allowed on the pitch (including inside the goals, technical areas and the referee review area) at any time during a game.
A player who makes unauthorised marks on the pitch must be shown a yellow card.
The pitch is divided into two equal halves by a halfway line. There is a centre spot at the midpoint of the halfway line and a centre circle with a 
radius of 9.15 m (10 yds) marked around it.
