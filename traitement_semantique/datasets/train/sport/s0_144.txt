responsibilities were to ensure the enforcement of the amateur code,
run national championships, and where appropriate send representa-tive teams to international competitions. Nevertheless, although suchvoluntary clubs and their governing bodies still form the central
means of delivering ‘amateur’ sport in Britain, the structure and
management of these organisations has become increasingly moresophisticated.
In recent years these organisations have become more commercial
and more ‘business like’ in their operations and management. Many
are no longer run solely by volunteers, but employ paid professionalcoaches and administrators to help oversee their operations. Fundingbodies such as the Sports Council and the growing number of com-
mercial sponsors involved in sport have demanded more ﬁnancial and
operating accountability, and this has resulted in an increase in formalpolicies and procedures. In addition, the volunteer managers, whotraditionally required only enthusiasm and a knowledge of the sportto do their job, are now having to possess a more sophisticated set ofmanagement skills as clubs and governing bodies engage in suchcomplex activities as applying for lottery funding, creating partner-ships with local authorities, and brokering television and sponsorship
agreements.
