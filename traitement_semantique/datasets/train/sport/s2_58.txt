DEFINITION
Arguing, complaining or protesting about a decision is known in the Laws as dissent. It can be verbal (with words) or physical (e.g. running at the 
referee, making gestures, kicking or throwing the ball away).
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN?
Players, substitutes, coaches and other team officials should respect the decisions of the referee and the other match officials.
An initial, non-exaggerated disagreement, objection or complaint is usually accepted by the referee as a natural reaction.
Clear and/or continual dissent (with words, actions or gestures) is punished with a yellow card and, if play is stopped because of the dissent, an 
indirect free kick is awarded to the other team.
If the words or gestures are offensive, insulting or abusive, the player must be shown a red card.
