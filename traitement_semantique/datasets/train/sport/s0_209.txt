most professional sports, football in particular, following tragedies at
Ibrox, Hillsborough and Bradford. The owners of a sports groundhave a legal duty to any spectators, whether or not they have paid towatch the game, and in the event of injury on the premises could be
liable for damages. Additionally, the Football Licensing Agency –
created under the Football Spectators Act of 1989 – is responsible fora certiﬁcation system to ensure that safety requirements are main-tained. With the Health and Safety Executive insisting that organisa-tions offer a safe working environment and the law being willing tostep in if spectators are injured, risk assessment has become an
important part of sports management.

SALARY CAP
In many sports, including rugby, ice hockey and basketball, the
league authorities have imposed a limit to the total salary bill of
individual clubs. The intention is to promote greater equality of
competition as part of an effort to maintain the viability of the
league concerned. Without such a salary cap, it is feared that the
wealthier clubs could dominate a competition by attracting the bestplayers with offers of higher wages than those available at other clubs.

SCHEMA THEORY
Developed by Richard Schmidt in the mid-1970s as an alternative toAdams’ closed loop theory and the ideas of peripheral and memory
trace as the mechanisms through which we control movement,schema theory could provide an answer to the question, ‘how can a
person respond to and perform successfully a novel task they have
never experienced before?’ Schema theory is based on the premisethat for any given class of movements, such as throwing, catching,jumping, etc., we develop a schema or set of rules. We abstract theserules from related experiences and construct a schema that will enableus to perform throwing, catching or jumping movements successfully.SCHEMA THEORY
