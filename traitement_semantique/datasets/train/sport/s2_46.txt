WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN?

• usually occurs around the middle of each half
• must not last more than one minute
• involves the players:

A cooling break:
• usually occurs around the middle of each half
• must not last more than three minutes
• involves the players: 
 >getting drinks from their team officials
 >sitting/standing in the shade (if possible) – they may leave the pitch to do so
• should not become a coaching session
The competition rules may define the weather conditions needed for drinks breaks and/or cooling breaks to be allowed. Temperature and humidity 
are the key factors to be taken into account.
If there are no specific competition rules, common sense is used when the temperature is high and/or it is very humid, and the referee decides 
whether a break is necessary.
The referee adds the time taken for any drinks/cooling breaks to the additional time at the end of the half in which they occurred.
WHAT HAPPENS IF…DRINKS & COOLING BREAKS
teams/players try to take a longer break than is allowed?
The referee must insist that the game restart promptly.
