torch relay which culminates in the opening ceremony has always
been associated with the modern Olympics but in fact it was
devised for the Berlin Games of 1936. Another major example is
the belief that William Webb Ellis invented rugby in the 1820s
when he picked up the ball and ran with it. There is no evidence
that this ever occurred but the myth was propounded seventy years laterwhen Rugby School wished to establish that the game was developedunder its auspices and had nothing to do with plebeian folk football.So much has the invented tradition succeeded in becoming estab-lished that the average British sports fan now almost invariablyassociates Webb Ellis with the development of rugby.

INVESTMENT
In strict economic terms, investment means the use of funds for theprovision of production or service facilities such as the building of astadium that will host sports events, but it is also often used in lay
terms to infer the purchase of shares in a company which may not
necessarily lead to any increase in output.
JAHN
Friedrich Ludwig Jahn (1778–1852) is generally credited with thedevelopment of Turnen or German gymnastics, but, although he
added to the range of exercises undertaken and equipment used, it is
clear that he borrowed many ideas from others, especially JohannFriedrich Guts Muth (1759–1839). His immediate objective was toend the Napoleonic occupation of Germany, and the anti-Frenchelement of his political agenda eventually widened into a rejection ofall things not German. He was not supported by his own govern-ment, which felt that his abrasive nationalism was too uncompro-mising, and indeed in 1818 T urnen was banned and not legalised
again till 1842. A fanatical nationalist who saw physical ﬁtness as a
basis for moral development, his name became indelibly linked
with Turnen following the political uniﬁcation of Germany in1871. Although his work had these political overtones, generally inBritain his name has been associated with the actual gymnasticactivities rather than the nationalistic philosophy attached to it.INVESTMENT
