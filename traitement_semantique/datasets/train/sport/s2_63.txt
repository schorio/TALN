a team scores a goal when one of their substitutes, substituted players, team officials or players who have gone off the pitch with 
an injury or to change kit, etc. is on the pitch without permission and the referee finds out before the game is restarted?
The referee must:
• disallow the goal
• take the correct disciplinary action (player, substitute, substituted player – yellow card; team official – red card)
• have the person removed from the pitch (substitute, substituted player, team official)
• restart play with a direct free kick from where the offending person was discovered by the referee
If the referee does not find out about the offending person until after the game has restarted, the referee must:
• allow the goal
• stop play (if the ball is in play)
• take the correct disciplinary action (player, substitute, substituted player – yellow card; team official – red card)
• have the person removed from the pitch (substitute, substituted player, team official)
• restart the game with a dropped ball or free kick (depending on the reason for stopping the game)
• submit a report to the appropriate authorities after the game >required to leave the pitch and the surrounding area for the rest of the game 
Exception:
If a substitute, substituted player, team official or player who has gone off the pitch with an injury or to change kit, etc. enters the pitch without 
permission and interferes with the ball when it is going into their team’s goal but it still goes in, the goal can be awarded if the interference 
did not stop a defender or the goalkeeper from playing the ball.
