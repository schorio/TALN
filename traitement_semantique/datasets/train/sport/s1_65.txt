1.1. Ball games
With all ball games, make sure that the ball you’re using is suitable for the children in your group. Standard footballs or volleyballs may be too heavy for smaller or 
weaker children, can cause injury on impact and can move too fast for some children with disabilities to track.  Some children with disabilities may be afraid of a hard ball 
which is travelling fast. Experiment with smaller, softer, slower, lighter balls such as 
foam balls or beach balls, and balls of different colours or textures which may be more attractive to the child.
