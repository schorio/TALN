examination courses in physical education at GCSE satisfy the criteria
for key stage 4.
Anomalies exist in that although swimming activities and outdoor
adventurous activities appear in the National Curriculum, they are in
many cases not practical realities for many students, owing to difﬁ-
culty of access and/or lack of funding.

KICK IT CAMPAIGN
This campaign is part of the attempt to rid professional football ofracism. Initially launched as ‘Kick racism out of football’ by theCommission for Racial Equality and the Professional Footballers’
Association in August 1993, its organisation was taken over by an
independent body, ‘Kick it Out’, which undertakes outreach workwith clubs, local authorities, ethnic minority communities and sup-
porters’ groups. It has received the support of the Football Associa-
tion and most clubs.
KREBS CYCLE
The Krebs cycle (named after Sir Hans Krebs who did much of thework elaborating the pathway) is also known as the citric acid cycle
(the ﬁrst constituent in the cycle is citric acid) or the tricarboxylic
acid cycle (TCA, the initial constituents have three carboxyl groups).This cycle and its associated enzymes are located in the mitochondriamatrix, either free or attached to the inner mitochondria membrane.The major function of this cycle is to act as the ﬁnal common path-way for the oxidation of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins which inturn result in the production of ATP and high energy reducingequivalents, NADH and FADH2.
Acetyl CoA is the entry substance in the TCA cycle and is the
product of carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolism. Acetyl CoAenters the cycle and in the presence of citrate synthase, combineswith oxaloacetate to form citrate. Citrate then follows a series ofreactions involving speciﬁc dehydrogenase enzymes that result in theproduction of reducing equivalents, the release of two molecules ofKREBS CYCLE
