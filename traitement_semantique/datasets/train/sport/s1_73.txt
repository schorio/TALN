1.3. Co-operative games
These are games where there is not necessarily a winner – the essence of the game 
is cooperation (having the children work together to reach a common goal), rather 
than competition. Parachutes games (described later in the chapter, section 1.6.3) are also excellent examples of cooperative games.
1.3.1. Hands and feet
This is a fun, gentle activity, with no winners and losers, which tests children’s creativity 
as well as their gymnastic skills! It’s suitable as a cool-down game.

How to play
 Divide children into groups of three. The aim of the game is for children 
to arrange themselves in a position according to the instruction of the play leader. The play leader calls out instructions about how many feet and hands must be touching the ground. Start with an easy instruction, eg. ‘six 
feet and no hands’ (ie the children stand normally). Make it progressively 
more difficult, eg. ‘four feet and two hands, ’ or ‘three feet and 
five hands. ’ Children have to creatively find ways of positioning 
themselves, eg. by carrying each other, resting their feet on the 
backs of another child, etc. The lower the number of feet, the 
harder the position! Give children a fixed amount of time to 
arrange themselves in each position.
Adaptations
This game can be quite complicated, so for younger children 
or children with learning difficulties, the children should work 
in pairs rather than groups of 3. Whereas older children could 
be in larger groups of 4 or 5.
How 
many feet? How 
many hands?!!
