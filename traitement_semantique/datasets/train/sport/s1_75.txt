1.4. Target games
Target games are non-contact sports which require limited physical movement, so 
they are suited to many children with disabilities. They can be played individually 
or in teams. More formalised target games (eg. darts, boccia) are described in section 2.
1.4.1. Beach ball blast 
Materials 
 Marker saucers  Smaller balls
 Hoops  Whistle
  Beach balls  Stop-watch
How to play
 Divide children into teams, eg. around 10 per team.
 Children from the first team form a circle, which is marked with marker saucers. 
Children are not allowed to step inside the circle. A hoop is placed in the centre of the circle 
 Place a beach ball (or similar lightweight ball) in the hoop/circle.
 Players take turns to propel (eg. throwing, rolling) smaller balls in order to knock the beach ball out of the hoop
 Time how long it takes for the team to knock the beach-ball out of the circle.
 Repeat with the other teams – the team with the fastest team is the winner!
Adaptations
Little mobility is needed in this game as children throw from a standing position. 
However a child with disability may need assistance in fetching thrown balls, so that she doesn’t have to keep on running after balls. You can also vary the distance children have to throw from.
