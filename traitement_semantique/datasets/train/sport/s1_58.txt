feedback from the children themselves, 
or from a colleague: ask them ‘how was the lesson today? Did everyone enjoy it? Did they learn something? Did everyone 
participate well? How can I improve?’
Some general advice when making adaptations using STEP:
	Think positively and creatively: there are no problems, 
only solutions.
	Take the risk to try something new -“to err is human” – you will make mistakes in the process of developing a new 
game or a new piece of equipment – that’s OK,  as long as you learn from them!
	Have confidence in yourself – don’t be afraid to be creative and to have your own ideas!Coaches in action – ‘is everyone paying attention? Is everyone following me?’
