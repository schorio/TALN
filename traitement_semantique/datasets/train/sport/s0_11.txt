/C15associated businesses and themes such as the media, have been
key to the history and development of sport; and do much to
enforce other concepts like globalisation. The book has therefore
identiﬁed the main external inﬂuences on the historic and on-going development of physical education and sports studies, anddeﬁned them in the context of their sporting role.

exemplars of concepts. For example, Michael Jordan is not an entry as
such, but is used as illustrative of the force of globalisation.INTRODUCTION
