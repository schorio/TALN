in races for prizes; pugilists, who were supported by their patrons to
participate in prize ﬁghts; jockeys, who rode as liveried servants foraristocratic and gentriﬁed owners; and cricketers, who, if not paiddirectly by their employer for playing cricket, were often found
employment as gardeners and the like so that they could represent the
estate owner in high-stake matches.
The widespread development of professionalism in late nineteenth-
century British sport led to controversy and debate in almost everysport as to whether the ruling bodies should recognise it and, if so,what safeguards should be imposed in the interests of amateur parti-cipants, the professionals themselves, and society in general. Thecommon theme of all the major criticisms was that of class antagon-
ism, the fear of the middle-class players and administrators that they
might lose both social position and sporting supremacy. Allied to thiswas a belief that professionals, whose livelihoods were at stake, wouldcommit fouls to ensure that they were not defeated, and, worse still,might be a source of corruption in what had been unsullied amateursport. In cricket it was acknowledged that the paid players wereindispensable to the game, for few amateurs could play throughoutthe season, and fewer still were prepared for the hard grind of county
championship bowling. Nevertheless the paid player was made aware
of his inferior social position both by nomenclature, in that amateurswere termed ‘gentlemen’ with its obvious social connotations, and bysymbolic subordination in that the amateurs and professionals ate,travelled, dressed for the game, and even entered the ﬁeld of play byseparate entrances, as well as being distinguished on the scorecard bythe initials of the amateur preceding his surname, with the reverse forthe paid player.
Perhaps the greatest divide between amateur and professional lay in
rowing. In 1879 the Henley authorities decided that no personshould be considered an amateur who had ever competed in opencompetition for a stake, money or entrance fee; who had ever com-peted with or against a professional for any prize; who had evertaught, pursued, or assisted in the practice of athletic exercises of anykind as a means of gaining a livelihood, or who had ever beenemployed in or about boats for money or wages. These were perhaps
reasonable conditions, but then followed a savage piece of class
legislation – the so-called ‘mechanic’s clause’ – which excludedanyone who was, or had ever been, by trade or employment forwages, a mechanic, artisan or labourer!
Rugby was late to embrace professionalism, and this occurred only
after a schism which irreconcilably split the organisation of the game.PROFESSIONALISM
